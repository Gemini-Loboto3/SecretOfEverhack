<$96>Hello, boy.<S $3D $80> You look like you'd be good at finding hidden ingredients.<$86><End>

<S $3D $80><Choice>Sure.

<$96>Well, you look like you've been through a lot!<$86>There are a lot of bugs and baddies out there.<S $B5 $80> They are probably giving you a hard time.<$86><End>

<$96>Thank you for fighting off those vicious Vipers.<$86>They treat this sacred Mammoth Graveyard as if it were only a source for bones and tusks.<$86><End>
<$96>Those guys were Vipers?<$86><End>
<$96>Yes--<S $3D $80>lizard people from the great volcano.<$86>They've been coming out in force lately,<S $79 $80> raiding the graveyard for mammoth parts.<$86><End>
<$96>When we get to the core of the volcano, we'll stop them before they do more harm.<$86><End>
<$96>Why are you going there?<S $3D $80> It's very dangerous!<$86><End>
<$96>Well, Fire Eyes told us about the volcano cooling and...<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes?<S $79 $80> Fire Eyes!<S $3D $80> Say no more.<$86>If you're a friend of Fire Eyes,<S $3D $80> then I know that I can trust you.<$86>You may find the means to enter the Vipers' domain at the top of the volcano, to the North.<$86>I'll let you through the gate.<$86><End>
<$96>Should I heal your wounds?
<$97><Choice>Yes.

<$96>The volcano?<S $3D $80> No.<S $3D $80> None but the way that would turn an adventurer into ash and molten bones.<$86><End>
<$96>Pardon me?<$86><End>
<$96>The only way that I know to enter the volcano is straight into the crater.<$86>Of course,<S $3D $80> come to think of it,<S $3D $80> you could try the catacombs at the base of the volcano.<$86><End>
<$96>I've seen a passage,<S $21 $80> <End>
but it's blocked by a big rock!<$86><End>
<$96>Levitation!<S $3D $80> That's a good solution!<$86>You can lift rocks and other heavy objects by using the Levitate Formula.<$86>I'll give it to you right now.<$86><End>
<$96>The formula requires a Mud Pepper and Water.<End>

<$96>How'd you find me?<S $79 $80>
I'm hiding here.<S $3D $80> I'm hiding from the Vipers.<$86><End>
<$96>We're going after the Vipers ourselves.<S $3D $80> They're cooling down the outside world.<$86><End>
<$96>They should be less of a threat now that we've defeated their leader.<$86><End>
<$96>Ahh.<S $3D $80> So, you're a couple of heroes, are you?<S $79 $80> Good for you!<$86>Let me give you something for the challenges ahead.<$86>This is the Speed Formula.<S $79 $80> It will increase your agility in battles.<$86>Just mix one part Wax with two parts Water and you're in business.<$86><End>

He was walking toward the big bug!<$86><End>
<$96>If you're going in after him,<S $3D $80> you should have another alchemy formula.<$86>Alchemy is quite useful.<S $3D $80> <$96>You take a little of this,<S $5B $80> and a little of that,<S $3D $80> and…<S $79 $80><$97>poof!<$96><S $97 $80> It's like magic!<$86>Let me give you the Hard Ball formula.<S $79 $80> It's an effective weapon.<$86><End>

<$96>Nice lizard, huh?<$86><$87>She knows how to sit,<S $3D $80> stay,<S $1F $80> shake hands<S $1F $80> and roll over.<$86><End>
<$96>You're a ferocious beast,<S $3D $80> but in a good way.<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes taught me to be cautious around ferocious looking animals.<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes told us about what you did for our village.<S $3D $80> Thank you!<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes is a good role model for young villagers like me.<S $79 $80>
I'm a big fan.<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes has taught us everything we know.<S $B5 $80><$87>I've learned basket weaving,<S $3D $80> bird calls<S $3D $80> and the metric system!<$97><$86><End>
<$96>We're supposed to stay away from wild animals,<S $3D $80> but you're OK.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not a wild animal are you?<S $79 $80> We're supposed to stay away from wild animals!<$86><End>
<$96>We thought we'd never see you again after that volcano blew!<$86>I'm glad you made it.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you visited Stong Heart lately?<$86>He's got a new formula that you should try out.<$86><End>
<$96>You saved Strong Heart in the tar!<S $79 $80> Now you can use that Claw to explore the jungle.<$86><End>
<$96>Strong Heart lives in the jungle.<S $3D $80> You can visit him by chopping through the brush!<$86><End>
<$96>We're not allowed to wander far from the village.<$86>But I've heard about a place where there are a lot of bugs and tar.<$86>My father, Strong Heart, went there days ago and he hasn't come back.<$86><End>
<$96>You look like a wild beast,<S $3D $80> but you're really a hero!<$86><End>
<$96>You look more friendly than the Vipers.<S $79 $80> I hope you behave yourself in our village.<$86><End>
<$96>Strong Heart went to the Bugmuck not long ago.<$86>He said that objects from the volcano landed there.<$86><End>
<$96>If we are to stop the cooling of the great volcano,<S $5B $80> we must send a hero to the source!<$86><End>
<$96>The great volcano is giving us less heat now!<S $5B $80> Something is terribly wrong!<$97><$86><End>
<$96>If hostile intruders were ever to enter our village, Fire Eyes would make them regret it.<$86><End>
<$96><$96>We of the village of Fire Eyes welcome peaceful visitors.<$86>I hear that you had a tough fight in the jungle.<S $79 $80> I hope you're OK now.<$86><End>
<$96>We of the village of Fire Eyes welcome peaceful visitors.<$86>Thank you for protecting us from those nasty raptors.<$86>Please stay for a while and have some nice Petals.<$86><End>
<$96>What a nice beast!<S $3D $80> You're man's best friend, you know!<$86><End>
<$96>If you make sure that Strong Heart is safe,<S $5B $80> I will give you one of my formulas.<$86><End>
<$96>I used to be the village alchemist, but now I've retired.<$86>I gave the practice to my friend, Strong Heart.<$86>He left for the Bugmuck to search for alchemy ingredients days ago, and he has not yet returned.<$86><End>
<$96>Alchemy is the practice of combining ingredients for powerful and often magical results.<$86>My family has used alchemy for many generations.<$86>Alchemy effects increase in strength when you use formulas often.<$86><End>
<$96>Dogs don't have any need for alchemy.<S $3D $80> They have their own special powers.<$86><End>
<$96>You have proven yourself to be a great warrior by saving Strong Heart.<$86>Thank you for your help and remember to use your alchemy ingredients wisely.<$86><End>
<$96>If you visit Strong Heart in his jungle hut,<S $3D $80> he may help you in your quest.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, Puppy.<S $3D $80> You can't carry any items, but your master can.<$86>He should stock up before he leaves the village.<$86><End>
<$96>There are many special items that you should bring along with you on your journey.<$86>Petals, Nectar and Honey heal wounds and replenish energy.<$86><End>
<$96>If your dog is completely out of energy,<S $3D $80> you can revive him with a Biscuit.<$86><End>
<$96>You can use Wings to escape quickly from caves and other dangerous interiors.<$86><End>
<$96>Pixie Dust will revive you if you have lost all of your energy.<$86><End>
<$96>Herbal Essence will cure you from poison and other bad states.<$86><End>
<$96>You should purchase as many supplies as you can carry before you leave the village.<$86><End>
<$96>Step back!<$86><End>
<$96>Call me if you need my help.<$86><End>
<$96><$87><$93>I don't know what's happening!<S $51 $80> If these quakes get worse, the village is doomed!<S $41 $81><End>
<$96><$87><$93>The quakes have never been this bad.<S $51 $80> I fear you may be right!<S $41 $81><End>

<$96><$87><$93>Strongheart,<S $3D $80> I must leave. But I'd like to thank you and the whole village.<S $91 $81><End>
<$87><$93>You've all been so kind to me!<S $B5 $80><$87>These ground shakes are getting worse and I'm afraid that's because of me.<S $E1 $81><End>
<$96><$87><$93>Fire Eyes…<S $29 $80> Elizabeth…<S $3D $80> Don't talk like this! The ground has shaken before. <S $2D $81><$87>It's not your fault.<S $B5 $80><End>
<$96><$87><$93>I'm afraid it is,<S $3D $80> dear friend.<S $5B $80> And things will only get worse if I stay.<S $19 $81><End>
<$96><$93>Elizabeth, <S $3D $80> are you ready to go?<S $79 $80><End>
<$96><$87><$93>Yes,<S $29 $80> in just a moment.<S $F1 $80><End>
<$96><$87><$93>Sniff…<S $29 $80> Strongheart…<S $51 $80> Sniff…<S $3D $80> I didn't think this would be so hard…<S $69 $81><End>
<$96><$87><$93>I know,<S $29 $80> little one.<S $3D $80> I know.<S $5B $80><$93>But you should go now.<S $51 $80> You're future is out there, not here.<S $69 $81><End>
<$96><$87><$93>You will always have a home here…
<S $8D $80>Fire Eyes!<S $F1 $80><End>
<$96>C'mon, <Dog>.<S $79 $80> Let's go talk to Fire Eyes.<$86><End>
<$96>You look tough.<S $3D $80> You probably don't need any armor.<$86><End>
<$96>But you might like a nice leather collar!<$86>Your master should buy one for you.<$86><End>
<$96>I recently crafted some new armor.<S $79 $80> It's quite strong.<$86><End>
<$96>An adventurer must have shielding out in the field.<S $3D $80> I deal in strong armor.<$86><End>
<$96>You should have this Jaguar Tooth Ring.<S $3D $80> It will allow you to run faster.<$86><End>
Received Jaguar Ring<End>
<$96>Press and hold the Run Button to go,<S $79 $80> but watch your energy.<S $3D $80> A long run will wear you out.<$86><End>
<$96>My!<S $3D $80> You look like a wild beast,<S $3D $80> but you act like a pussycat.<$86><End>
<$96>You're the young man who saved our village from the big freeze!<$86><End>
<$96>Please take this Honey with my thanks.<$86><End>
<$96>Thank you for looking out for our village.<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes will be happy to see you.<S $3D $80> You're the hero of the village!<$86><End>
<$96>Let me give you some Petals for your long journey.<$86><End>
Received a Petal<End>
<$96>You can also find items in gourds and pots.<$86>The people of this village don't mind if you take items.<$86>We know that you'll return the favor by helping us in some way.<$86><End>

<$96>You can also find items in gourds and pots.<$86>The people of this village don't mind if you take items.<$86>We know that you'll return the favor by helping us in some way.<$86><End>
<$96>My!<S $3D $80> That was quite a fight that you had in the jungle.<S $B5 $80> You should be more careful!<$86><End>
<$96>If you learn alchemy formulas, you can find ingredients for them along the jungle paths.<$86><End>
<$96>You can also find items in gourds and pots.<$86>The people of this village don't mind if you take items.<$86>We know that you'll return the favor by helping us in some way.<$86><End>
<$96>You look tired.<S $3D $80>
You should have a nice meal and rest at the Inn.<S $5B $80> It's just next door.<$86><End>
<$96>You should also collect items from gourds and pots before you leave the village.<$86>The people of this village don't mind if you take items.<$86>We know that you'll return the favor by helping us in some way.<$86><End>
<$96>You look pooped pooch.<S $3D $80> You could use some rest.<$86><End>
<$96>Since you've recovered from your injuries,<S $3D $80> you can continue your quest.<$86>Stop by anytime if you need a rest.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, friend.
<S $3D $80>Welcome to my inn.<$86><End>
Would you like to rest for 10 talons?
<$97><Choice>Sure.
<Choice>No, thanks.<End>
<$87><$96>I hope you had a good rest.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>You can exchange other currencies for talons at any shop.<$86><End>
<$96>Are you OK, kid?<S $3D $80> You took quite a beating out there!<$86><End>
<$96>Whoa!<S $3D $80> What happened?<$86><End>
<$96>The raptors got you!<S $79 $80> They're a tricky lot,<S $3D $80>
they are!<$86><End>
<$96>Thanks to this wild animal here,<S $3D $80> you were saved!<$86><End>
<$96>That's no wild animal. <End>
<$96>That's my dog!<S $79 $80> He's just not himself right now.<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> now that you're both safe in our friendly village…<$86>…you can save your game!<S $3D $80> OK?<S $3D $80>
<$97><Choice>Sure.
<Choice>No thanks.<End>
Fire Eyes' Village<End>
<$87><$96>OK,<S $3D $80> fine.<$86><End>
<$96>Feel free to take items from the gourds in this village.<$86>We know that you'll return the favor.<S $79 $80> And you definitely need the help.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not a wild beast after all!<S $3D $80> You're a hero!<$86><End>
<$96>Wild beasts are not allowed in our village, but you look pretty tame.<$86><End>
<$96>Strong Heart took another trip to the Bugmuck recently.<$86>He said that a lot of debris from the volcano ended up there.<$86><End>
<$96>You should talk to Strong Heart.<S $3D $80> He has developed a new formula.<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the entrance to the Vipers' volcano world is blocked by a giant boulder.<$97><$86>Strong Heart saw it when he was searching for alchemy ingredients.<$86><End>
<$96>The Vipers are a mean bunch.<S $79 $80> I'd fight them myself if I thought that I had a chance.<$86>But, my brother, Strong Heart is the gutsy one in the family.<$86><End>
<$96>I'd go to the Bugmuck to search for Strong Heart if I were a more adventurous guy.<$86>Maybe you can search for him after you've learned an alchemy spell.<$86>I'll provide you with ingredients.<$86><End>
<$96>My brother, Strong Heart, told me that he was going to look for the big bug in the Bugmuck.<$86>He said that there may be rare alchemy ingredients hidden in the bug's skeleton.<$86><End>
<$96>Strong Heart searches the area often for ingredients.<$86>And when he returns, he always gives some of them to me.<$86>Then, I sell them to townspeople who know alchemy formulas.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, traveler.<S $79 $80> I'm the source for goods in this village.<$86><End>
<$96>You should have this Jaguar Tooth Ring.<S $3D $80> It will allow you to run faster.<$86><End>
Received Jaguar Ring<End>
<$96>Press and hold the A Button to run,<S $79 $80> but watch your energy.<S $3D $80> A long run will wear you out.<$86><End>
<$96>You'd probably like some dog treats.<S $3D $80> Maybe your master will buy some for you.<$86><End>
<$96>You and your master make a good adventuring team!<$86><End>
<$96>You're quite a frightening beast.<S $3D $80> Did you come from the jungle or the Bugmuck?<$86><End>
<$96>Was that you that we saw flying on the back of that four-winged bird?<S $B5 $80> Nice!<$86><End>
<$96>The Vipers get material for their weapons in the Mammoth Graveyard to the Northeast.<$97><$86><End>
<$96>Thanks for fighting off the creatures outside our village. <S $79 $80><End>
Please take this Grass Vest.<$97><$86><End>
<$86><End>
<$96>The jungle is full of vicious beasts, like the Vipers from the volcano.<$86>Make sure that you're well equipped before you go out there.<$86><End>
<$96>I've been to the Bugmuck in the East and I've seen the giant bug!<$86>That may be where Strong Heart went to explore.<$86><End>
Would you like to equip or unequip your spells?
<Choice>Sure.
<Choice>Not right now.<End>
<$96>Hiya,<S $3D $80> <Dog>.<S $3D $80> You're not a bad dog after all.<$86><End>
<$96>Sorry about the {wild beast} comment.<S $79 $80> I'm sure you're a nice dog.<$86><End>
<$96>Thanks for your all of you help, <Boy>.<$86>Let me know if you find a passage back to Podunk.<$86><End>
<$96>The volcano to the north is rapidly giving off less heat.<$86>We need you to investigate and stop the big freeze.<$86><End>
<$96>Go east through the quicksand fields to the Bugmuck.<$86>if you find Strong Heart there and help him out,<S $3D $80> I'll help you.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi <Boy>.<S $79 $80> You look like you've been through a lot!<$86><End>
<$96>That's for sure!<$86><End>
<$96>Strong Heart told me that he saw you riding on the back of a giant bird!<$86><End>
<$96>Actually,<S $79 $80> it's a flying machine!<S $79 $80> My friend Tinker Tinderbox made it!<$86><End>
<$96>You know of other people in this world?<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah!<$86><End>
<$96>And two of them are from Podunk--<S $3D $80> Horace and Camellia!<$86><End>
<$96>Interesting!<S $3D $80> I know them! <S $B5 $80><End>
They were part of the experiment!<$86><End>
<$96>The only one that's not accounted for is my grandfather.<S $B5 $80> I wonder where he could be!<$86><End>
<$96>I think he might be in some sort of strange space station.<$86>And Tinker's going to help me and <Dog> get there.<$86>That might be our only way to get back to Podunk!<$86><End>
<$96>Now, we're on a mission to find items that Tinker needs in order to send us into space.<$86><End>
<$96>We've already found the pieces of the volcano machine that we need<$86><End>
<$96>We've already found the gauges of the volcano machine on the slope.<$86>Now we just have to find the big wheel!<$86><End>
<$96>We've already found the wheel of the volcano machine in the big bug.<$86>Now we just have to find the gauges!<$86><End>
<$96>Two of the items are parts of a big machine that was at the heart of the volcano.<$86><End>
<$96>Well!<S $3D $80> You've been busy!<$86><End>
<$96>When the volcano blew, a lot of the debris landed in the Bugmuck.<$86>That might be a good place for you to search.<$86><End>
<$96>You might search the slope of the volcano.<S $07 $80>o Some of the debris landed there.<$86><End>
<$96>When the volcano blew,<S $3D $80> most of the debris landed on the slope and in the Bugmuck.<$86>Those would be good places for you to search.<$86><End>
<$96>We sure have!<$86><End>
<$96>Thanks for the advice.<$86><End>
<$96>By the way.<S $3D $80> When you were in that experiment…<$86>…was anybody else there besides you, Horace, Camellia and your grandfather?<$86>Because someone is causing a lot of trouble around here!<$86>And that person might have had something to do with the experiment.<$86><End>
<$96>That's an interesting theory…<$86><End>
<$96>…But no one else was there.<S $B5 $80> No one except for…<S $3D $80> <End>
<$96>the butler.<$86><End>
<$96>But he was just a robot--<S $79 $80> programmed to clean the house and serve guests.<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> we're going to get to the bottom of this when we get to the space station.<$86><End>
<$96>Good luck.<S $79 $80> Let me know if you find a passage back to Podunk. <S $B5 $80>I miss the place.<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that you had quite a fight in the jungle.<$86><End>
<$96>Is that the wild beast that saved you?<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah.<S $3D $80> But,<S $1F $80> he's not a wild beast.<S $79 $80> He's my dog.<$86><End>
<$96>Who let this wild beast in here?<$86><End>
<$96>Oh.<S $1F $80> That's my dog.<S $3D $80> He hasn't been himself lately.<$86><End>
<$96>What's his name?<$86><End>
<$96>His name?<S $3D $80> It's…<$86><End>
<$96><$82>!<$86><End>
<$96>{<Dog>?}<S $3D $80> That's.<S $15 $80>.<S $15 $80>.<S $15 $80> original.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not from around here,<S $5B $80> are you?<$97><$86><End>
<$96>I'm not really sure where {here} is,<S $5B $80> to tell you the truth.<$86><End>
<$96>You're on Evermore,<S $3D $80> in my prehistoric village.<S $79 $80>
I'm the leader.<$97><$86><End>
<$96>You wouldn't know how to get to Podunk from here,<S $79 $80> would you?<$86><End>
<$96>Podunk?<S $3D $80> Hmmmm… <S $5B $80>interesting.<S $79 $80> I might!<$86><End>
<$96>Maybe we can work something out.<$86><End>
<$96>How'd you like to make yourself useful around here?<$86><End>
<$96>Well, I…<$86><End>
<$96>The new village alchemist, Strong Heart, has wandered off to the Bugmuck in the East.<$86><End>
<$96>He's been searching for alchemy ingredients that are plentiful in the muck.<$86><End>
<$96>If you can help him get back to the village,<S $5B $80> I will help you with whatever you need.<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> as Captain Leif Meldrock says in {Mars Needs Lumberjacks:}<$86><End>
<$96>{I'm ready for anything!}<$86><End>
<$96>Before you go…<$86><End>
<$96>I'd like for you to have an alchemy formula that I've developed.<$86>I call it {Flash.}<S $B5 $80> It's pretty powerful against mean creatures.<$86><End>
<$96>You can use the formula whenever you have 1 part Wax and 2 parts Oil.<$86>Just select the spell and let it fly.<$86>The more you use the Flash Formula, the stronger it will get.<$86><End>
<$96>Cool! Thanks!<$86><End>
<$96>I hear you were victorious in the far reaches of the Bugmuck.<$86><End>
<$96>Well, it was a bug hunt,<S $79 $80> but we got out of it OK.<S $79 $80> And we got a nifty Claw, too.<S $3D $80> It's like an axe!<$86><End>
<$96>Well that's…<S $3D $80> that's great.<$86><End>
<$96>Strong Heart has returned to his hut, south of the village.<$86><End>
<$96>And, now the village faces a new crisis.<$86>The volcano to the north is rapidly cooling down.<$86><End>
<$96>If this trend continues we could have an ice age on our hands.<$86><End>
<$96>I'd like to help you, but I've really got to start looking for a way back home.<$86><End>
<$96>Your best bet may be to track down the source of this atmospheric icing.<$86><End>
<$96>You see, I'm originally from Podunk, too.<$86>My Grandpa is an inventor who lived in the mansion on the hill!<$86>He made a machine that could send people to worlds of their own design.<$86><End>
Since I enjoy all things prehistoric, I dreamed up this world of cave people and dinosaurs.<$86><End>
<$96>I was supposed to be here for a couple of hours,<S $79 $80> but it's been a couple of decades.<$86><End>
<$96>Now and again,<S $3D $80> I sense evidence of outside influences on our world.<$86><End>
<$96>This recent drop in temperature could be the work of someone from the real world.<$86>And that person has control over the vicious volcano Vipers.<$86>If you go to the source,<S $3D $80> at the center of the volcano…<$86>…you might find someone or something that could lead you back home.<$86>And you might just save our village at the same time.<$86><End>
<$96>Wow! This is like what happens in {The Pale People of Planet V.}<$86>It's about a bunch of astronauts who get stuck on an exact replica of Earth…<$86>…only it's populated by zombie vampires and…<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> actually,<S $3D $80> this isn't like that at all.<$86><End>
<$96>If you're finished with your little anecdote…<$86>…I can give you the ability to call on me in difficult situations.<$86><End>
Received 6 Call Beads<End>
<$96>If you need my help, especially in big battles, you can throw a Call Bead to the ground.<$86>I'll appear in a flash.<S $3D $80> Then you'll be able to summon one of my spells.<$86><End>
<$96>No offense,<S $3D $80> but how can a girl help a couple of adventurers like us?<$86><End>
<$96>I've learned a few tricks since I've been here.<$86>Let me show you why they call me {Fire Eyes.}<$97><S $F1 $80><End>
<$96>You're a good dog!<S $3D $80> We appreciate your brave deeds.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not one of the creepy creatures from the volcano, are you?<$86><End>
<$96>You're the hero who vanquished the Vipers!<S $3D $80> Good work!<$86><End>
<$96>The new alchemist, Strong Heart, is wise and powerful.<S $3D $80> He can help you in your journey.<$86><End>
<$96>If Strong Heart had taken Fire Eyes' advice,<S $3D $80> he wouldn't have wandered far.<$86><End>
<$96>The Vipers and other jungle beasts dare not enter our village.<$86>Fire Eyes protects us from them.<$86><End>
<$96>Please feel free to take the contents of my pots and gourds.<$86>You'll need them if you plan to go into the jungle.<$86><End>
<$96>It's not the great caverns of Makanda,<S $3D $80>
but it's home.<$86><End>
<$96>Well, if you like mud walls and leaf floors,<S $3D $80>
it's pretty nice.<$86><End>
<$96>I don't have much to offer in the way of thanks for saving my hut…<$86><$96>…but I would like for you to have…<$86><End>
<$96>That's not it.<$86><End>
<$96>Hmmmm…<S $3D $80>I can't see how this would be of much use to you.<$86><End>
<$96>A still-beating heart!<S $3D $80> Nice!<S $3D $80> But not what you need.<$86><End>

<$96>I hope that you use your alchemy formulas well.<$86>Would you like to equip or unequip your spells?
<S $3D $80><Choice>Sure.

<$96>Stay here, <Dog>.<S $3D $80> These stairs are too steep for you.<$86><End>
<$96>Did you hear that explosion a while back?<S $3D $80> It rocked the boat good!<$86><End>
<$96>The new leader of Nobilia has the Diamond Eyes.<S $79 $80> I think he's fixing to do something bad.<$86><End>
<$96>I hear that you had a part in defeating that power hungry leader of Nobilia.<S $3D $80> Good work!<$86><End>
<$96>You're the Sacred Dog!<S $79 $80> You must know where the Diamond Eyes are hidden.<$86>C'mon, you can tell me.<S $79 $80> I won't tell anyone.<$86><End>
<$96>I knew a man named Tiny, once. <S $51 $80>He was quite a man with rocks.<$86><End>
<$96>The Diamond Eyes fell into the wrong hands.<S $79 $80> And now they're missing again, aren't they?<$86><End>
<$96>The city leader has posted a reward for the treasures on the other side of the river.<$86>I'm going after them,<S $5B $80>
I am.<$86><End>
<$96>You're a good jumper, and a good explorer, too, from what I hear.<$86><End>
<$96>The bridge to the west has been washed out by the flood.<$86>You could probably jump the gap if you wanted to.<$86><End>
<$96>A brute named Tiny dropped a boulder on me boss.<$86>I'd like to thank him someday.<$86><End>
<$96>Even as a small boy, I knew I wanted to be a rogue.<$86><End>
<$96>I saw the strong man, Tiny, heading across the river a while back.<$86>He had a few rocks with him. <S $51 $80>I wonder what he's up to.<$86><End>
<$96>There's a city on the other side of the great desert.<$86>You might convince the ghost pirate to give you passage across the sand.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, little buddy.<S $3D $80> You look like you could sniff out a cargo hold full of hidden treasure.<$86><End>
<$96>I hear that you found the treasure on the right side of the river.<$86><End>
<$96>And then you lost it again.<S $79 $80> Bad break.<$86><End>
<$96>There's treasure to be found on the west bank of the river.<$86>And I'm the one that's going to find it!<$86><End>
<$96>You took care of that greedy, evil leader!<S $3D $80> Well done.<$86><End>
<$96>The Diamond Eyes have been stolen by the new leader of Nobilia!<$86>I gather he's gone back to the city to reign over this world with their power.<$86><End>
<$96>You're new to Crustacia, aren't you?<S $79 $80> The people in this town look mean, but we're not that bad.<$86><$96>But, it's every rogue for himself on the other side of the river.<$86><End>
Hours later…<End>
<$96>Whoa!<S $3D $80> Now I know how `Dandy' Don Carlisle felt in `Sink, Boat, Sink!'<$86>I think I've got water in every orifice, pocket and pore!<$86><End>
<$96>Hmmm…<S $3D $80> No sign of <Dog>.<$86><End>
<$96><Dog>?<S $79 $80> Nope!<$86><End>

<$96>Visitors! <S $51 $80> Oh, joy! <S $51 $80>I've been so lonely here.<$86>I was sent here as punishment. <S $65 $80>The beasts won't attack me in this corner.<$86><End>
<$96>Young man! <S $51 $80>Your company is most welcome. <S $51 $80>And don't worry. The beasts won't attack us in this corner.<$86><End>
<$96>Tiny has found a home here. <S $51 $80>Leave Tiny and Tiny's friends alone!<$86>Oglins understand Tiny<S $65 $80> and Tiny feels at peace.<S $65 $80> Leave now,<S $3D $80> before Tiny must crush you!<$85><End>
<$96>Stop! <S $3D $80>Tiny gives up! <S $51 $80>Please don't hurt Tiny.<$86>Tiny lifts <S $51 $80>and Tiny throws <S $3D $80>and Tiny speaks in the third person,<S $51 $80> but Tiny doesn't fight.<$86>Take the Diamond Eyes and go!<$85><End>

<$96>Please stop gloating! <S $5B $80>Take the Diamond Eyes and go! <S $5B $80>Leave Tiny alone with his shame.<$86><End>

<$96>Tiny must be around.<S $51 $80> This looks like one of his rocks.<$85><End>

<$96>Likewise!<S $3D $80> My dog and I used your boat to float downstream and over the falls…<$86><End>
<$96>Ahh!<S $3D $80> Well done!<$86>I escaped by floating down with swamp flowers full of the essence of Mud Pepper!<$86><End>
<$96>You're a good little trooper.<$86>I'm glad you haven't let that Sacred Dog stuff go to your head.<$86><End>
<$96>You and your dog are brave adventurers.<S $3D $80>
I'm very proud of you.<$86><End>
<$96>You found your dog!<S $3D $80> And he's in one piece, too!<S $79 $80> Well done!<$86>Here's something that will ensure that he's always in good health.<$86>It's the Revive Formula.<$86>Mix three parts Root with one part Bone to give your dog life when his energy is depleted.<$86><End>
<$96>You can use my bridge to cross over to the desert and search for your pooch.<$86><End>

<$96>Likewise!<S $3D $80> My dog and I used your boat to float downstream and over the falls…<$86><End>
<$96>Ahh!<S $3D $80> Well done!<$86>I escaped by floating down with swamp flowers full of the essence of Mud Pepper!<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen this world?<S $B5 $80> It's much different from the world on the plateau!<$86><End>
<$96>I've explored a little,<S $41 $80><End>
<$96> but I've mainly been looking for <Dog>.<$86><End>
I wonder where he could be…<S $79 $80> or what he could be…<$86><End>
<$96>Wow!<S $3D $80> It sure took a long time for that rock to fall!<$86><End>
<$96>Well, friend…<$86><End>
<$96>It's time for you to find your pooch and for me to continue my studies of things lighter than air.<$86>I hear that there's a great city on the other side of the desert, to the North.<$86>You might have luck looking for your dog there.<$86>You can cross over to the desert on my new bridge!<$86>Before you take off,<S $3D $80>
I want you to have this Crush Formula.<$86>You can mix Limestone and Wax for enemy crushing power.<$86><End>

<$96>Do you mind?<S $79 $80> We're trying to hit each other here!<$86><End>
<$96>That lad Tiny the Barbarian came through here not long ago.<$86> I think he's up to something.<$86><End>
<$96>There are tales of hidden treasure and jewels in the land across the river.<$86>I'd go there, but I think I'll wait until the weather clears up.<$86><End>
<$96>Arrgh.<S $79 $80> The flood waters are a scourge,<S $3D $80> they are!<$86><End>
<$96>The leader of Nobilia turned out to be a real sap.<$86>But I hear that you sent him on his way.<S $79 $80> Well done.<$86><End>
<$96>The leader of Nobilia, up to the north, just came into power.<$86>I'd only trust him as far as I could throw him.<$86>I'm not sure what that means,<S $3D $80> but it sounds tough.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not after treasure and riches like the rest of these louts,<S $79 $80> are you?<$86>The last thing we need is more adventurers around here.<$86><End>
<$96>My brother, Tiny, told me that his actions made a tunnel open up on the west side of the river.<$86>I think he went over there to take a look.<$86><End>
<$96>My brother, Tiny, is the strongest man in these parts.<$86><End>
Now he's in Nobilia, working in the market.<$86>It's honest work for a man like my brother.<$86><End>
<$96>I wish he could make some friends.<$86><End>
<$96>The explosion on the west bank of the river has opened new passages.<$86>They may lead to treasure!<$86><End>
<$96>I hear that the leader of Nobilia plans to use the Diamond Eyes for evil deeds.<$86><End>
<$96>We may talk tough in Crustacia, but we're pretty harmless.<$86>The rogues on the west bank are much meaner.<$86><End>
<$96>The leader of Nobilia was much too greedy for power.<S $79 $80> It lead to his downfall, it did.<$86><End>
<$96>They say that if you control the Diamond Eyes, you control the world.<$86>And the leader of Nobilia aims to do just that.<$86><End>
<$96>The treasures on the west bank are very valuable indeed.<$86>The leader of Nobilia has posted a fine reward for them.<$86><End>
<$96>If I found them, though, I might just keep them for myself!<$86><End>
<$96>Too bad about that statue of yours in Nobilia.<S $3D $80> I bet it's in a million pieces now!<$86><End>
<$96>You look like you could jump over the break in the washed out bridge!<$86><End>
<$96>Now that some of the river has drained, parts of the Great Pyramid are easier to get to.<$86>I wonder if there's more treasure to be found.<$86><End>
<$96>Since the river waters have risen,<S $3D $80> some of us adventuring types have been staying inside.<$86><End>
<$96>I've heard stories of a great pyramid on the other side of the river.<$86>It's probably surrounded by the flood waters.<$86><End>
<$96>The Hall of Collosia is across the river and due north.<$86>They say that the walls of the Hall are not as solid as they seem.<$86><End>
<$96>I'll be searching for treasures as soon as the flood waters recede.<$86><End>
<$96>You should take a nap.<S $3D $80> You look tired.<$86><End>
<$96>Ahoy, Matey.
<S $79 $80>Welcome to my inn.
<S $79 $80>Please stay and rest.<$86><End>

<$96>You look like a fine animal.<S $3D $80> Maybe your master will buy you a treat.<$86><End>
<$96>I have a variety of items for sale.<S $3D $80> I can offer them to you for a very fair price.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, little buddy.<S $3D $80> I'm sorry.<S $3D $80> I don't have any armor that you can wear.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, matey.<S $3D $80> You'll be wanting to buy some of my armor.<S $3D $80> It's the best.<$86><End>

<$87><$96>OK,<S $3D $80> fine.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>Are you sure?
<Choice>Yes.
<Choice>Forget it.<End>
<$87><$96>It's probably better that way.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>Wow!<S $3D $80> I didn't think anyone would ever come up with the cash!<$86>I mean, you had to fight a lot of spiders and thieves to get that kind of money!<$86>Since you went to so much trouble to buy this, basically, worthless piece of<S $79 $80> c<S $8D $80>r<S $8D $80>a<S $C9 $80>ss jewelry.<$86>I'm going to throw in a free gift!<$86><End>

<$96>Vigor,<S $3D $80> the champion,<S $3D $80> is going to battle today!<S $3D $80> I'm his biggest fan.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $3D $80> You're the new champion!<S $3D $80> I'm your biggest fan!<$86><End>
<$96>You're a nice animal.<S $3D $80> Don't let that Sacred Dog thing get to your head.<$86><End>
<$96>Rumor has it that the leader has found the Sacred Dog!<S $79 $80> We'll find out in the big meeting.<$86><End>
<$96>You showed that evil head that he can't be a bully!<S $3D $80> Good job!<$86><End>
<$96>You showed that gladiator that he can't be a bully!<S $3D $80> Good job!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, puppy.<S $3D $80> I like your style.<$86><End>
<$96>There's a lot of neat stuff that you can get in the marketplace.<$86>You should do some shopping.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen your statue in the city square?<S $3D $80> <End>
Now it's just a big hole in the ground!<$86><End>
It's very nice.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen Tiny?<S $3D $80> I haven't heard from him since that big explosion!<$86><End>
<$96>This statue was commissioned by our new leader to honor his mentor.<$86>I think it's a little pretentious.<$86><End>
<$96>I am Tiny the Barbarian.<S $3D $80> I am the strongest creature alive.<$86><End>
Nobody lifts my rock but me!<$86><End>
<$96>You know,<S $3D $80> It's ironic that your name is {Tiny,}<S $79 $80> because you're actually very large.<$86><End>
<$96>Yes.<S $97 $80> <End>
Tiny likes irony.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $79 $80> <End>
Don't do that!<$86><End>
<$96>You may be the Sacred Dog,<S $79 $80> <End>
<$85>ut you can't lift big rocks like Tiny can!<$86><End>

<S $79 $80><$96> Clear the way!<S $3D $80> <End>
<$96>This is going to be good!<$86><End>
<$96>Now,<S $3D $80> that's how you lift a rock!<$86><End>
<$96>I wonder if that rock will ever land.<$86><End>
<$96>It looks like we've got our work cut out for us, <Dog>.<$86>There's a town on the other side of the desert.<S $3D $80> We can cross the river there.<$86>Then, we can start searching for those diamonds.<$86><End>
<$96>You stay here, <Dog>.<S $B5 $80> Stay!<$86>And don't get into any more trouble!<$86><End>
<$96>You wait here.<S $79 $80> Tiny waits outside.<$86><End>
<$96>That way, nobody gets hurt!<$86><End>
<$96>Not until you fight Vigor, anyway.<$86><End>
<$96>That guy has some sense of humor!<$86><End>
<$96>Greetings, challenger.<S $3D $80>
I am Pompolonius, advisor to the new leader of Nobilia.<$86><End>
<$96>Uh,<S $3D $80> hi.<S $3D $80> I'm <Boy>.<S $79 $80> There's been some sort of mistake!<$86>I'm not really the gladiator-fighting type!<$86><End>
<$96>But, you were chosen.<$86><End>
<$96>There's no denying that!<S $79 $80> You're going to fight!<$86><End>
<$96>Now,<S $3D $80> I'm going to leave,<S $3D $80> and let you prepare.<$86>The gate will close behind me.<$86>When it opens again, that's your cue to come out fighting!<$86><End>
Should I record your progress?
<$97><Choice>Yes!
<Choice>Uh, no.<$96><End>
<$96>Well, <Dog>.<S $3D $80> This is another fine mess you've gotten us into.<$86>Here I am, about to take on some tooth-spitting, sword-carrying champion gladiator…<$86>…and all I've got is a femur, a claw and a stick!<$86><End>

<$96><$93>You called on me, Sir?<S $F1 $80><End>
<$96><$93>Yes, Pompolonius, I am ready to take my next step toward greatness.<S $A5 $81><$87><S $21 $80><$96><$93>As my advisor, you can help me obtain the overwhelming power that I desire.<S $95 $82><$87><S $21 $80><End>
<$96><$93>I must have the Diamond Eyes of the Dog Statue.<S $69 $81><End>
<$96><$93>But, Sir.<S $B5 $80><$87><End>
<$96><$93>The people will not support your actions unless we receive a sign from the Sacred Dog!<S $1D $82><$87><S $21 $80><End>
<$96><$93>I hate to burst your bubble, Pomp,<S $3D $80> but the Sacred Dog is a myth.<S $A5 $81><$96><$93><$87>We can't expect for some mystic creature to simply slide into the palace!<S $95 $82><End>
<$96><$93>Uh, Sir.<S $3D $80> We have a visitor.<S $F1 $80><End>
<$96><$93>Have you found the Diamond Eyes yet, Number Two?<S $2D $81><End>
<$96><$93>Not yet, Your Cleanliness.<S $2D $81><$87><S $3D $80><$96><$93>But I have offered a reward to the adventurers in the town on the river shore…<S $A5 $81><End>
<$96><$93>Do you mean to tell me that you have those unkempt cretins looking for the jewels?<S $E1 $81><$87><S $21 $80><$93>This is an important job…<S $B5 $80><$87><S $21 $80><$93>…not something that should be left to brutes with no sense of personal hygiene.<S $59 $82><End>
<$96><$93>They may not be clean,<S $3D $80> but they do know their way around this world.<S $A5 $81><$87><S $21 $80><End>
<$96><$93>The boy that you warned me about is also looking for the jewels.<S $A5 $81><$87><S $21 $80><$93>If he survives,<S $3D $80> I'll have a little surprise for him and his dog when they return.<S $59 $82><End>
<$96><$93>We've already had a problem with that meddling kid on the plateau, Number Two.<S $1D $82><$87><S $21 $80><$93>Don't let that happen here.<S $F1 $80><$87><S $21 $80><$93>And try to keep the old coot on the other side of the river out of this.<S $1D $82><End>

<$96>I don't believe a word this guy says.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, boy.<S $3D $80> You look like you're ready to go on an adventure.<$86><End>
<$96>If it's beads you're after, you can find the best deal in a booth on the west wall.<$86><End>
<$96>What a fine dog.<S $3D $80> You're so well behaved, too.<$86><End>
<$96>The appraiser at the south end of the market will buy market items that you don't need.<$86><End>
<$96>You look like you would be good at finding treasure.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $3D $80> Have you heard about the big explosion on the west side of the river?<$86>They say that it opened up a passage to a new world!<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the flood waters washed ashore a treasure chest with 50 jewels in it!<$86>There must be a hidden cache somewhere below the surface.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm thrilled to hear they're rebuilding your statue.<$86><End>
<$96>I always enjoyed your statue in the square.<S $3D $80> It was a good likeness.<$86><End>
<$96>I've always enjoyed your statue in the square.<S $3D $80> It's a good likeness.<$86><End>
<$96>If you've got currencies other than Jewels, you can exchange them at the exchange booth.<$86>It's near the main exit to the city square.<$86><End>
<$96>You're the Sacred Dog!<S $3D $80> You've probably been on a lot of great adventures!<$86><End>
<$96>Are you going on an adventure?<S $79 $80> That's what I'm gonna do when I'm as tall as you.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi!<S $3D $80> I'm a big fan!<S $3D $80> Could I have your autograph?<$86><End>
<$96>The Sacred Dog is my second favorite celebrity animal, <S $79 $80>right after Muff, the mummified cat!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello there, boy.<S $3D $80> You're a good dog.<S $3D $80> Yes, you are!<$86><End>
<$96>You were very kind to that philosopher.<S $3D $80> He's kind of nutty after all.<$86><End>
<$96>I believed everything that philosopher said, up until the point where he turned into a <End>
<$96>goat.<$86><End>
<$96>chicken.<$86><End>
<$96>basket.<$86><End>
<$96>This fellow is very insightful.<S $3D $80> He has a lot of important things to say.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, boy.<S $3D $80> You're a good dog, aren't you?<S $79 $80> Now, run along.<S $3D $80> I'm watchin' the juggler.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $3D $80> You're the guy who defeated the evil leader!<S $3D $80> That was a good show!<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $3D $80> You're the guy who defeated the champion!<S $3D $80> That was a good show!<$86><End>
<$96>If they want to attract a crowd for the big meeting,<S $3D $80> they should put this guy on the bill.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, you're the Sacred Dog!<S $3D $80> Cool!<$86><End>
<$96>If you think this guy is good,<S $3D $80> you should see him when he's juggling mummified cats.<$86>That's a sight to see!<$86><End>
<$96>What a majestic animal!<S $3D $80> I've alway been a big fan.<$86><End>
<$96>The merchants in the north end of the market specialize in food and other goods.<$86>The merchants in the south end sell charms and other mysterious items.<$86><End>
<$96>The Sacred Dog!<S $3D $80> You're probably very good at finding treasures,<S $3D $80> aren't you?<$86><End>
<$96>You should equip yourself with good armor if you plan to go out on an adventure.<$86>There are three armor merchants in the market.<$86><End>
<$96>What an honor it is to meet you.<S $3D $80> <End>
Your statue looked just like you.<$86><End>
Your statue looks just like you.<$86><End>
<$96>The world has been so confusing lately.<$86>I may become a follower of the Sacred Chicken.<$86><End>
<$96>I saw Tiny heading for the west side of the river after that explosion.<$86>You never know what he and his rocks are up to.<$85><End>
<$96>Have you seen the statue of the Sacred Dog in the city square?<S $3D $80> It's absolutely wonderful!<$86><End>
<$96>Since you're the Sacred Dog, you've probably been in the palace, haven't you?<$86>I hear that it's magnificent!<$86><End>
<$96>The palace gate is north of the city square.<$86>I've never been to the palace,<S $3D $80> but I hear that it's magnificent.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi, boy!<S $3D $80> You look like a good runner,<S $3D $80> and a good jumper, too!<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the explosion near the river diverted the water.<$86>Now the west branch of the river is dry!<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the bridge across the river is washed out.<$86>You'd have to be a really good jumper to make it to the other side.<$86><End>
<$96>I hope your new statue does you justice.<$86><End>
<$96>Your statue didn't do you justice.<S $3D $80><End>
<$96>Your statue doesn't do you justice.<S $3D $80><End>
You're a handsome dog!<$86><End>
<$96>Were you out in the desert?<S $79 $80> That's hot!<S $3D $80> We only travel when it's cool.<$86><End>
<$96>This place is empty!<S $3D $80> The big meeting in the city square is probably starting!<$86><End>
<$96>We've got to go to the city square.<$86>That guy with the Diamond Eyes is probably placing them in the statue right now!<$86><End>
Received 100 Jewels<End>
<$96>That was easy.<S $3D $80> But, I think we've got a tough battle ahead.<$86><End>
<$96>I don't think that guy who took the Diamond Eyes was Horace at all!<$86><$96>He looked pretty suspicious.<$86>I bet he's planning to use those Diamonds for something devious!<$86>And he's probably going to the city on the other end of the desert!<$86><End>
<$96>That guy looked pretty suspicious.<$86>I bet he's planning to use those Diamonds for something devious!<$86>And he's probably going to the city on the other end of the desert!<$86><End>

<$96>Ah,<S $3D $80> <Boy>!<$86>I'm glad to see that you're still alive!<S $B5 $80> Have you found the Diamond Eyes?<$86><End>
<$96>Hi Horace!<S $3D $80> Yeah!<S $3D $80> I've got them right here!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, <Boy>.<$86>We haven't met before,<S $79 $80> but your acquisition of the Diamond Eyes will help me a great deal.<$86><End>
<$96>You must be the leader of that city on the other side of the desert!<$86>I've got the diamonds right here.<$86><End>
<$96>I must have them!<S $3D $80> Give them to me!<$86><End>
<$96>Uh,<S $3D $80> OK.<S $41 $80> <End>

 Guaaaahaha!<$86><End>
<$96>Guaaaahaha?<S $79 $80> This guy is looney!<S $3D $80> Like {Metalhead} McGovern in {Lunky Monkey}.<$86>C'mon, <Dog>.<S $3D $80> Let's follow him.<S $B5 $80> I think he's gone off the deep end!<$86><End>
<$96>Not so fast, kid.<S $3D $80> Our boss wants you to stay where you are.<$86><End>

<$96>Sacred Dogs… <S $51 $80>I don't believe in 'em!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello. My wife and myself take care of cleaning and maintaining the palace.<$86><End>
<$96>My husband complains about all the work around here.<$86>Truth is, I do the work and he does the complaining.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi there. <S $3D $80>Don't track any dirt into the palace.<S $3D $80> It's my job to keep the place clean.<$86><End>
<$96>You should avoid falling into those pits!<S $3D $80> Are you OK?<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah.<S $3D $80> I guess I should use that Revealer Formula more effectively.<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah.<S $3D $80> Maybe I should talk to your friend and get that Revealer Formula.<$86><End>
<$96>That's a good idea.<$86><End>
<$96>Are you OK?<S $3D $80> You took quite a spill out there!<$86><End>
<$96>I think I'll be all right.<S $3D $80> We're getting used to flying and falling.<$86><End>
<$96>Who are you,<S $3D $80> friend?<S $79 $80> Where are you from?<$86><End>
<$96>Well, I…<$86><End>
<$96>By Golly!<S $3D $80> What have we here?<S $79 $80> A visitor?<$86><End>
<$96>You're definitely not from Crustacia--<S $79 $80>no facial hair, tattoos or visible scars.<$86><End>
<$96>And you're not from Nobilia, either--<S $79 $80>no toga or sandals.<$86><End>
<$96>Actually,<S $3D $80> we're from…<$86><End>
<$96>Wait!<S $41 $80><End>
<$96> Let me guess!<S $B5 $80>
<$96>You're from... <S $B5 $80>Podunk!<$86><End>
<$96>Wow!<S $3D $80> You're right!<S $41 $80> I'm <Boy><End>
 and this is my dog,<S $41 $80> <Dog>.<$86><End>
<$96>It's a pleasure to meet you.<S $3D $80> I'm Horace Highwater.<S $B5 $80> I, too, am from Podunk.<$86>I figured that it would just be a matter of time before another Podunker arrived.<$86><End>
<$96>You see,<S $3D $80> this ancient world is a product of my imagination.<$86><End>
<$96>I was the curator of the Natural History Museum in Podunk.<$86>My area of expertise was early civilizations,<S $79 $80> and…<$86><End>
<$96>You were part of an experiment in the big mansion on the hill,<S $81 $80> and something went wrong!<$86><End>
<$96>That's right!<S $3D $80> Terribly wrong!<S $79 $80> <End>
How did you know?<$86><End>
<$96>Fire Eyes,<S $5B $80> er,<S $5B $80> Elizabeth told us about it.<S $B5 $80> She's the leader of the prehistoric world on the plateau.<$86><End>
<$96>Yes!<S $3D $80> Elizabeth, Professor Ruffleberg's granddaughter!<$86><End>
<$96>There was another guest at that party, too.<S $79 $80> Miss Bluegarden, the librarian.<$86>I've always suspected that we were the victims of foul play,<S $79 $80> but by whose hand?<$86><End>
<$96>I don't know.<S $21 $80> <End>
<$96>But I think we can find out if we get the other Diamond Eye.<$86>We already found one in the pyramid and this guy in the city told us about another one.<$86><End>
<$96>But I think we can find out if we get the other Diamond Eye.<$86>We already found one in the Hall of Collosia and there's supposed to be another one, too.<$86><End>
<$96>But I think we can find out if we get these special diamonds.<$86>An important guy in the city told me that they were very powerful.<$86><End>
<$96>So,<S $3D $80> the new leader is after the Diamond Eyes,<S $3D $80> is he?<S $79 $80> I thought he would be.<$86><End>
They do represent a lot of power,<S $B5 $80> and this fellow is hungry for power.<$86>He appeared on the scene only weeks ago and took over Nobilia very quickly indeed.<$86><End>
He's very mysterious.<S $79 $80> None of my contacts has ever even seen his face!<$86>I would suspect that he has nothing but bad intentions.<$86><End>
<$96>What should we do?<$86><End>
<$96>Chances are that the leader has other people looking for the diamonds, too.<$86><End>
<$96>I suggest that you find the other diamond and bring them both to me!<$86><End>
<$96>I suggest that you find the diamonds first and bring them to me when you have both of them!<$86><End>
I'll make sure that they don't fall into the wrong hands!<$86><End>
<$96>The other diamond is in the Great Pyramid, to the South.<$86><End>
<$96>The other diamond is in the Hall of Collosia, to the North.<$86><End>
<$96>The diamonds are in the Hall of Collosia to the North and the Great Pyramid to the South.<$86><End>
<$96>We've dug pits that protect these sites from harmful intruders.<$86>You can see hidden paths over these pits by using the Revealer Formula.<$86><End>
<$96>My friend, Madronius, will give you this formula if you talk to him.<$86><End>
<$96>OK!<S $41 $80> <End>
We'll do it!<$86><End>
<$96>You and your master have an important mission.<$86>The people of this world are depending on you.<$86><End>
<$96>I would like to assist you in your endeavour to recover the Diamond Eyes,<S $79 $80> <Boy>.<$86>In studying this ancient world,<S $79 $80> I have stumbled upon the ability to practice magic.<$86>If you need me, use a Call Bead, then call on me.<S $79 $80> I'll materialize and help you with my magic.<$86>You may uncover other spells that I can use in your travels.<$86><End>

<$96>Hello, Pup.<S $3D $80> You look a lot like that Sacred Dog that they've made statues for in Nobilia.<$86><End>
<$96>It sounds like you've had a very interesting adventure indeed.<$86>I am Madronius, the alchemist.<S $3D $80> I've studied with Horace for many years.<$86>The new leader of Nobilia does not respect the treasures of our world.<$86>We have dug pits in front of the Pyramid and Hall in order to keep him and his men away.<$86>My Revealer Formula will allow you to see the paths across these pits.<$86><End>
<$96>We're counting on you to save the treasures of our world.<$86><End>
<$96>Horace has left the camp.<S $3D $80> You might find him on the west bank of the river.<$86><End>
<$96>I trust that you are doing all that you can in order to find the Diamond Eyes.<$86><$96>Here is the Escape Formula.<$86>It will allow you to leave underground areas and other interiors in a hurry.<$86><End>
<$96>The Escape Formula requires one part Wax and one part Vinegar.<$86><End>

<$96>Uh,<S $1F $80> no problem.<$86><End>
<$96>You can call me `Blimp.'<S $3D $80>
I work with Swamp Gas and Fume Bugs.<$86><End>
<$96>Oh!<S $3D $80> That explains the stench!<$86><End>
<$96>Hmm<S $0B $80>.<S $0B $80>.<S $0B $80>.<S $0B $80>I haven't noticed.<S $3D $80> Come on in, kid.<S $3D $80> I'll show you my place.<$86><End>

<$96>Hey, kid!<S $3D $80> Give me a hand with this snake!<S $3D $80> It's getting out of control!<$86><End>
Is that a door I hear?<$86><End>
<$96>I'm glad we missed those big spikes.<S $3D $80> That would've hurt!<$86><End>
<$96>Well, <Dog>.<S $3D $80> I think our experiments with gravity have been a success.<$86><End>
<$96>We've really got to stop falling into pits!<$86><End>
<$96>Uh, excuse me.<S $3D $80> Yeah!<S $3D $80> You!<S $3D $80> On the other side of the glass!<$86>Could you please stop making us fall off of ledges?<S $B5 $80> It's not very nice.<$86><End>
<$96>That looks like a switch on the other side of the pit.<$86>If I had something to throw, I could hit it.<$86><End>
<$96>I hit the switch. I guess I need a heavier spear.<$86><End>
<$96>What a fine animal you are!<$86><End>
<$96>Greetings, young friend.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm glad we found that secret passage in the pit!<S $B5 $80> Now,<S $3D $80> let's not go down there again.<$86><End>
StopStomp cleared<End>
StopStomp set<End>
<$96>That looks like a switch on the other side of the pit.<$86>If I had something to throw, I could hit it.<$86><End>
<$96>I hit the switch. I guess I need a heavier spear.<$86><End>
<$96>Madronius?<S $3D $80> Is that you?<$86><End>
<$96>I'm not Madronius,<S $3D $80> but I am his brother.<S $3D $80> How do you know him?<$86><End>
<$96>He gave me the Revealer Formula so that I could cross big pits and find the Diamond Eyes.<$86><End>
<$96>It's a good idea to collect the Diamond Eyes now.<$86><End>
I hear that there are others looking for them, too.<$86><End>
I can help you on your journey with this Fireball Formula.<$86><End>
<$96>You'll need one part Brimstone and two parts Ash in order to use the formula.<$86><End>
<$96>You're a fine dog,<S $3D $80> and with good hunting instincts, too!<$86><End>
<$96>Here's a nice collar for you.<S $3D $80> It'll protect you in difficult situations.<$86><End>
Received Spiky Collar<End>
<$96>I hope that you are using your ingredients wisely.<S $3D $80> They're hard to come by in here.<$86><End>
Received a Bronze Spear!<End>
<$96>Looks like we're a little too late, <Dog>.<$86><End>
<$96>I will now command the Ancient World with supreme power...<$86><End>
<$96>...for I have the Diamond Eyes of the Sacred Dog Statue!<$86><End>
<$96>That guy takes himself way too seriously,<S $B5 $80> like Emperor Zorn in {Acropolis Apocalypse}<$86><End>
<$96>Let the menacing begin!<$86><End>
<$96>Whoa!<S $41 $80> That guy was a serious head case!<$86><End>
<$96>Good work, <Boy>!<S $3D $80> You saved our world from that terrible villain.<$86>He was my evil twin!<S $79 $80> And a robot of some sort, I suspect.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm glad we could help, Horace!<$86><End>
<$96>Good work, son!<S $3D $80> You did very well!<$86><End>

<$96>I'm Horace Highwater.<S $3D $80> This ancient world is a product of my imagination.<$86>That villain was my evil twin.<S $79 $80> A robot of some sort, I suspect.<$86><End>
<$96>Wow! Just like what happened with Fire Eyes!<$86><End>
<$96>Hmmm…<S $3D $80> The statue's energy core looks like it could explode at any moment!<$86>We should remove it,<S $79 $80> and soon!<$86><End>
<$96>Tiny!<S $3D $80> Tiny!<S $3D $80> Come here!<S $3D $80> We need your strength!<$86><End>
<$96>I am Tiny the Barbarian.<S $79 $80> My strength is needed.<$86><End>
<$96>We need you to throw this energy core as far as you can from the city before it explodes.<$86>Can you do it, Tiny?<$86><End>
<$96>I am Tiny the Barbarian.<S $41 $80> I am very strong.<S $79 $80><End>
 I can throw anything!<$86><End>
<$96>Step aside.<$86><End>
<$96>That felt good!<$86><End>
<$96>That guy has a pretty good arm!<$86><End>
<$96>Yes.<S $21 $80> And his heart is in the right place, too.<$86><End>
<$96>I just hope that his incredible strength doesn't go to his head.<$86><End>
<$96>So,<S $3D $80> how do you suppose <Dog> and I could get to Podunk from here?<$86><End>
<$96>I'd like to know that myself.<$86><End>
<$96>I…<S $21 $80> <End>
I'm not sure…<$86><End>
<$96>Horace!<S $3D $80> We have important news from the camp!<$86><End>
<$96>Oh!<S $3D $80> Hello, Madronius.<S $3D $80> What is it?<$86><End>
<$96>The explosive hit just north of the camp and opened up an entrance to a very large tunnel!<$86>This tunnel may lead to unexplored territories of Evermore!<$86><End>
<$96>Hmm… a hidden tunnel!<S $3D $80> Very interesting indeed!<$86><End>
<$96>Thank you for the news, Madronius!<$86><End>
<$96>This could be your answer, <End>
<$96><$81>!<$86><End>
<$96>son! <$86><End>
<$96>Your passage to Podunk could start on the other end of that tunnel!<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> it's worth a try!<$86><End>
<$96>Before you leave,<S $3D $80> let me help you.<$86><End>

<$96>Hmmm... I can't see the bottom. I'd better avoid these vents.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, <Dog>! Get away from there!<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, <Dog>!!<S $3D $80> Where are you going?<S $51 $80> Come back here!!<S $B5 $80><End>
Won't Open<End>
<$96><$87><Dog>!!<S $3D $80> You're back!!<S $51 $80> I was very worried. Don't do that again!!<$85><End>
<$96>Hmmm…<S $3D $80> This looks dangerous. I'd better avoid these vents.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, <Dog>! Don't go near the edge!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, little one.<S $3D $80> I don't get many visitors down here.<$86><$96>This key around your neck will help in the castle.<$86><End>
<$96>My, but you're a furry little boy!<S $51 $80> Your mother must be worried. Now run along!<$86><End>
<$96>Ohhhhh! My bursitis!<S $51 $80> Now where's my tonic?<$86><End>
<$96>Well, <Dog>.<S $3D $80> Looks like we're off to Ebon Keep.<$86>Hey, <S $29 $80> What's that around your neck? <S $51 $80>A key!<$86>I don't know where you got it, but I'll hang on to it.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>Ah!<S $3D $80> Mr. <Boy>!<S $3D $80> So nice to see that you made it through the night.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>I didn't mean to react so harshly at the banquet.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>But I just hate it when things don't go as planned!<$86><End>
<$96>Uh,<S $3D $80> that's OK. <S $51 $80>We're really sorry for the mess we made.<$86><End>
<$87>And we're hoping, maybe, you could help us find our way home?<$86><End>
<$96>There will be time for that later!<S $79 $80> This meeting is really about me--<S $79 $80> my needs!<$86><End>
You may have heard that there is another castle in the kingdom.<$86><End>
That castle,<S $3D $80> Ebon Keep,<S $3D $80> is our former home and it is filthy.<$86><End>
That's why I had this castle built and moved the kingdom across the ravine.<$86><End>
A few stragglers remain in the other castle,<S $3D $80> and this annoys me to no end!<$86><End>
I want to remove them!<S $3D $80> And you can help me do that!<$86><End>
The entrance to Ebon Keep is on the other side of the chessboard plateau.<$86>But the drawbridge on the other side is now up!<S $79 $80> Locked!<$86><End>
What we need you to do is go down into the ravine, come up the other side…<$86>…and open the drawbridge from within.<$86><End>
Then, my people will march across the ravine and take Ebon Keep by force!<$86>Can you do this for me, Mr. <Boy>?<$86><End>
Yeah.<S $3D $80> Sure.<S $3D $80> I guess.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>The best way to the ravine is through the east wing of the castle.<$86>Then down through a door in the chessboard.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>You'll find it when you get there.<$85><End>
<$96>Go away, you smelly creature!<$86><End>
<$96>You really should think about bathing, young man!<$86><End>
<$96>Your task at hand is to go to the chessboard and find a door to the bottom of the ravine.<$86><$87>Then,<S $3D $80> you must make your way to Ebon Keep and open the drawbridge from within.<$86><$87>We'll take it from there.<$86><End>
<$96>Go away, you stinky boy!<$86><End>
<$96>Go away, you putrid pup!<$86><End>
<$96><$87>Your majesty.<S $51 $80> I've brought the prisoners as requested.<$86><End>
<$96>Your highness.<$85><End>
<$96>Yes, Eronio.<$86><End>
<$96>What have you done with the boy and his pig dog?<$86><End>
<$96>I've sent them on a little journey.<S $3D $80> They're going to the other side of the ravine.<$85><End>
<$96>Aren't you afraid that they'll learn more than they should from our {friends} in Ebon Keep?<$85><End>
<$96>They'll never get that far!<S $3D $80> The dragons will take care of them first!<$86><End>
Besides, if they do get to the other side alive, and they don't do what I told them to do…<$86>…I'll take care of them when they come back.<$85><End>
<$96>Bwa… ha… ha!!!<$85><End>
<$87><$96>Whew!<S $3D $80> I'm glad we're out of that sewer.<$85><End>
<$87><$96>Sniff… sniff…<S $3D $80> I agree, <Dog>.<S $3D $80> We'll probably stink for a while.<$85><End>
<$87><$96>Oh no!<S $3D $80> A Guard!<$85><End>
<$87><$96>Stay right where you are, little mister!<$86><End>
<$87><$96>Thought you could escape?<S $51 $80> Didn't you?<$86><$87><$96>Well, I have orders that the queen is waiting to see you.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>You're coming with me!<S $65 $80> Sniff… <S $3D $80>Sniff… <S $3D $80> Do you smell something?<$86><End>
Locked<End>
<$96>Gotta go! <S $3D $80>GOTTA GO!! <S $3D $80>Aaaaaaahhh…!!!<$85><End>
<$96>They've gone!<S $51 $80> Everybody's gone! <S $65 $80>They must've all gone back to Ebon Keep!<$86>All alone here… <S $65 $80> Gotta go! <S $3D $80>GOTTA GO!! <S $3D $80>Aaaaaaahhh…!!!<$85><End>
<$96>Oh, my! <S $51 $80> Oh, dear! <S $51 $80> They're gone! <S $51 $80>They're GONE!!<S $51 $80> Aaaahhhhh!!!<$85><End>
Whew! <S $3D $80>That was close!<$85><End>
<$96>I hate my job enough without dealing with mutts!<$85><End>
<$96>I'm so lonely. I wish my brother George were here.<$85><End>
<$96>So what if I sleep on the job! I'm guarding rubble. Rubble I say!<S $65 $80> Oh, the shame… the shame… <$85><End>
<$96>Boy, I tell you.<S $51 $80> You goof one assignment and they send you off to guard rubble!<$86>That's all that's here since everyone went back to Ebon Keep.<$85><End>
Bitten by a Mazquito!<End>

<$96>You probably don't enjoy a good bargain since you're a canine.<$86>Animals don't have an appreciation for commerce.<$86><End>
<$96>The merchants in this market offer pretty good deals.<$86>You should be able to satisfy all of your shopping needs.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi, Puff.<S $3D $80> That's some fancy hairdo you have!<$86><End>
<$96>This market is small compared to some.<S $79 $80> But, there are still bargains-a-plenty.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, little buddy.<S $3D $80> It's nice of you to come to our new, old town.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, little buddy.<S $3D $80> It's nice of you to come to our little town.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi, kid.<S $3D $80> Welcome to the town of Ebon Keep.<S $79 $80> It's the new happiest place on Evermore!<$86><End>
<$96>Hi, kid.<S $3D $80> Welcome to the town of Ivor Tower.<S $79 $80> It's the happiest place on Evermore!<$86><End>
<$96>Well!<S $3D $80> You're a pretty little dog, aren't you?<$86><End>
<$96>I would have never guessed that the queen in Ivor Town was a fake!<S $F1 $80> You're sharp!<$86><End>
<$96>Not long ago, our queen had Ivor Tower built and moved here from Ebon Keep.<$86>Most of the citizens followed because the queen promised comfort and happiness for all.<$86>I think the others went because of the free food and drink.<$85><End>
<$96>What a nice animal!<S $3D $80> You look a lot like my pig.<S $3D $80> His name is {Prince.}<$86><End>
<$96>Say!<S $3D $80> You look a lot like a pig.<S $79 $80> No offense.<$85><End>
<$96>We've moved back to our old town.<S $79 $80> And it's better than ever, thanks to you.<$86><End>
<$96>Are you going to the pig race?<S $3D $80> It's the festival's big event!<$86>The owner of the winning pig will be invited to the big feast with the queen.<$86><End>
<$96>I hear that the queen has sent you on a quest to the other side of the ravine!<S $B5 $80> Good luck!<$86><End>
<$96>Hi pooch!<S $3D $80> You're a nice animal, and so fluffy, too!<$86><End>
<$96>I'm glad things are back to normal.<S $3D $80> I missed old Ebon Keep!<$86><End>
<$96>Did you hear?<S $79 $80> There's going to be a pig race on the west side of town!<$86>I like pigs,<S $79 $80> especially fast ones!<$86><End>
<$96>Wasn't that pig race wonderful?<S $79 $80> It was so exciting and unpredictable!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, Princess!<S $3D $80> Come to Momma!<S $3D $80> Yes.<S $3D $80> You're a good little dog!<$86><End>
<$96>I thought there was something wrong with the queen.<$86>I'm glad the real one is back with her subjects where she belongs!<$86><End>
<$96>The queen has been very nice lately, in a sort of sickeningly sweet kind of way.<$86>And the king!<S $3D $80> The king has been gone!<$86>I just can't figure out those royals!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, pretty puppy.<S $3D $80> What's your name?<S $3D $80> {Fifi?}<S $3D $80> {Petunia?}<$86><End>
<$96>My mother says that Ebon Keep isn't as spotless as Ivor Tower was,<S $79 $80> but it's home.<$86><End>
<$96>My mother went into the new castle once.<S $79 $80> She said that it's really big,<S $79 $80>
and spotless!<$86><End>
<$96>You should watch out for my brother.<S $3D $80> He chases dogs.<S $3D $80> I know that's not very nice.<$86><End>
<$96>Queen Bluegarden is our leader again!<S $79 $80> For real!<S $79 $80> Thanks!<$86><End>
<$96>The queen has always been kind as long as I can remember.<$86>She's still nice, but in a fakey kind of way.<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, puppy.<S $3D $80> You better watch out,<S $79 $80> or I'm gonna pull your tail!<$86><End>
<$96>We walked over the chessboard when we moved back to Ebon Keep.<$86>The trap door that leads to the Dark Forest was open.<$86>I heard that there's another trap door that goes down the other side.<$86><End>
<$96>No one goes out onto the chessboard between the castles anymore.<$86>But,<S $29 $80> I heard that there's a trap door there that leads to the floor of the ravine.<$86><End>
<$96>You may be frou-frou,<S $79 $80> but the monsters in the ravine are no match for you!<$85><End>
<$96>You oughta stay in town.<S $3D $80> The ravine is packed with dragons and other nasty beasts.<$86>It's much too challenging for a frou-frou dog like you.<$85><End>
<$96>You've proven yourself to be quite an adventurer.<S $79 $80> Well done.<S $79 $80> Good job.<$86><End>
<$96>The ravine has many a monster.<S $3D $80> You must be well equipped to travel there.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>OK.<S $3D $80> Maybe some other time.<$86><End>
<$96>I can offer fine crafted beads to you for the incredible price of 15 Gold Coins each.<$86><End>

<Choice>Three.<End>
<$96><$87>It's a deal.<S $1F $80> Enjoy your beads.<$86><End>
<$96>Good for trading and cooking, my spices are only 12 Gold Coins per jar.<$86><End>

<$96>You have not seen anything until you've seen Perceval Plank's Exhibition of Oddities.<$86>A ticket to this entertainment spectacle will set you back one Amulet of Annihilation.<$86>What do you say?
<$97><Choice>I'll take it!
<Choice>Some other time.<End>
<$87><$96>Thank you very much.<S $3D $80> The exhibition is at the north end of the alley to the west.<$86>Enjoy the show!<$86><End>
<$87><$96>Uh, pardon me?<S $3D $80> Do I look like a sucker?<$86>You don't have an Amulet of Annihilation, kid.<S $79 $80>
No Amulet,<S $79 $80> no ticket.<$86><End>
<$96>You already traded for my best item.<S $3D $80> I don't have anything else for you.<$86><End>
<$96>The Oracle Bone can make people say things that they would not otherwise say.<$86>The person who possesses it will hear many important secrets.<$86>And it can be yours for a Golden Jackal Statuette and a Jeweled Scarab.<$86>Is it a deal?
<$97><Choice>Sure.
<Choice>No way.<End>
<$87><$96>Thank you.<S $3D $80> May you learn much from your possession of the Oracle Bone.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>I'm sorry.<S $3D $80> You don't have the items that I require for the trade.<$86><End>
<$96>Sorry, kid.<S $3D $80> You have the Thug's Cloak already.<$86>I don't have anything else for you.<$86><End>
<$96>With the Thug's Cloak in your possession, you'll be able to evade attacks more successfully.<$86>I can trade it to you for 8 bottles of perfume and 6 beads.<$86>Is it a trade?
<$97><Choice>OK.
<Choice>I don't think so.<End>
<$87><$96>Good choice.<S $3D $80> The Thug's cloak will help you greatly.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>You don't have enough goods to swing the deal.<S $3D $80> Sorry.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm sorry.<S $3D $80> I only exchange Gold Coins to humans.<$86><End>
<$96>I provide Gold Coins in exchange for other types of money.<$86>Would you like to exchange currencies?
<Choice>Sure.
<Choice>No thanks.<End>
<$96>You will absolutely love this beautifully scented perfume.<$86>I can give it to you for only two jars of spice per bottle.<$86>What do you say?
<$97><Choice>Let's trade
<Choice>No thanks.<End>
<$87><$96>How many bottles?
<Choice>One.
<Choice>Two.
<Choice>Three.<End>
<$96><$87>The deal is sealed.<S $3D $80> Thanks.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not allowed in the castle.<S $79 $80> Only the queen and other important people may enter.<$86>I make sure that nobodies like you stay away.<$86><End>
<$96>The queen has a more {open door} policy than her evil robot twin had.<$86>I think it's for the better,<S $79 $80> but it's good to keep a tight ship, too!<$86><End>
<$96>The queen said that you could enter the castle.<S $79 $80> But, make sure to wipe your feet first, OK?<$86><End>
<$96>Uh,<S $3D $80> excuse me.<S $79 $80> There are no dogs allowed in the castle,<S $79 $80> OK?<$86><End>
<$96>You and your master may enter the castle.<S $79 $80> But don't touch anything, OK?<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, pooch.<S $79 $80> This town is just as happy as Ivor Tower.<$86>And it has fewer evil twins, too!<$86><End>
<$96>Hey, pooch.<S $79 $80> How do you like our happy town?<S $79 $80> Pretty nice, huh?<$86><End>
<$96>You should get your master to buy you a new collar.<S $3D $80> He can find them at the store.<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that you had quite an adventure in the ravine!<$86>Now you've got more adventures ahead of you!<$86><End>
<$96>You should be prepared if you plan to venture beyond our town.<$86>They say that the ravine is populated by dragons.<$86><End>
<$96>Animals are welcome in the new, improved Ebon Keep.<$86>Our restored queen isn't as much of a clean freak as her evil twin was.<$86><End>
<$96>We don't have a lot of animals in our little town.<S $79 $80> The queen wants to keep the place clean.<$86><End>
<$96>They say that the evil twin robot queen was looking for some sort of energy source.<$86><End>
<$96>But, no one knows what it is, or where it could be.<$86><End>
<$96>I think that it could be under the chessboard!<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen our giant chessboard?<$86>It's on the plateau in the ravine, between Ebon Keep, and our new castle, Ivor Tower.<$86><End>
<$96>What a nice little dog!<$86>Do you like being being scratched behind the ears?<S $3D $80> My dog {King} does!<$86><End>
<$96>First we lived in Ebon Keep, then we lived in Ivor Tower.<$86>Now we live in Ebon Keep again.<$86>I'm getting a little confused and I'm quite tired of moving.<$86><End>
<$96>Not long ago all of us moved from Ebon Keep to this new town.<$86>The queen wanted a place that was cleaner and more controlled.<$86><End>
<$96>You're a strange looking creature.<$86>But you're not as strange as those Oglins,<S $79 $80> or so I've heard!<$86><End>
<$96>There's a group of mysterious creatures that lurk below the surface.<$86>They're called {Oglins.}<$86>My brother saw one once.<S $79 $80> He said that it was seven feet tall with red eyes and big claws!<$86><End>
<$96>The new, original Queen Bluegarden likes animals, especially pink, fluffy poodles.<$86><End>
<$96>Hiya pooch!<S $3D $80> We don't see many animals around here!<S $3D $80> The queen likes to keep the place clean.<$86><End>
<$96>That evil robot queen sure was,<S $3D $80> uh,<S $3D $80> evil,<S $79 $80> wasn't she?<$86><End>
<$96>The queen says that the old town has been taken over by mean creatures.<$86>But, she's going to take care of them!<$86><End>
<$96>You look like you could fit into small spaces.<S $3D $80> That's good for finding treasure sometimes.<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the chessboard between the castles has two trap doors!<S $79 $80> Cool!<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen that chessboard between the old castle and the new one?<$86>They say that the pieces used to move by themselves!<$86><End>
<$96>The winner of the pig race is here to meet the queen.<$85><End>
<$96>Arrrgh! I had a weeks pay bet on Truffle Trouble.<$86><$96>Go on in before I change my mind.<$85><End>

<$96>Well, hello friend.<S $3D $80> My name's Lance.<S $3D $80> I live here.<$86>You're not messing around with any of my stuff, are you?<$86><End>
<$96>Uh, no.<S $3D $80> We were just looking around.<$86>We wouldn't open your treasure chests or anything without your permission.<$86><End>
<$96>That's good!<S $3D $80> You're a nice kid!<S $3D $80> Where are you from?<$86><End>
<$96>Podunk!<S $3D $80> We're on an adventure.<$86><End>
<$96>That's the spirit!<S $79 $80> <End>
I like to go out into uncharted territory myself.<$86><End>
<$96>I've found quite a few treasures that way.<$86><End>
<$96>Say!<S $79 $80> Here's something that you might appreciate.<$86>It's my very own alchemy formula.<S $79 $80> I call it {Lance.}<$86><End>
<$96>Just mix Iron with Acorn and you'll hit mean creatures with a sharp attack.<$86><End>
<$96>Feel free to look through my treasure chests.<$86>You might find something that you can use on your adventure.<$86><End>
<$96>You don't look like the adventuring sort, pup.<S $3D $80> But, looks can be deceiving.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm sure that you have an exciting adventure ahead of you.<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> you're a sight to see,<S $3D $80> aren't you?<S $79 $80> Where's your little pink bow, huh?<$86><End>
<$96>Things are different now that we're back in Ebon Keep with our original queen.<$86><$96>We're allowed to be happy, or not happy.<S $79 $80>
It's our choice.<$86><End>
<$96>Welcome to Ivor Tower, young man.<S $79 $80> We're very happy here.<S $79 $80> The queen likes it that way!<$86><End>
<$96>You don't look like you're very tough.<$86>,You've got to put some meat on your bones and exercise.<$86><End>
<$96>I had heard stories about this Gomi character and his tower,<S $79 $80> quite some time ago.<$86>It turns out that he's not as nutty as we all thought.<$86><End>
<$96>I've heard stories about a strange old man in the nothern part of the ravine.<$86>They say that he's building a tower to the sky!<S $79 $80> Crazy, huh?<$86><End>
<$96>You're a funny looking pooch.<$86><End>
You're not part of that exhibition on the west side of town, are you?<$86><End>
<$96>It turns out that the exhibition in Ivor Tower was put there by the evil robot queen.<$86>She wanted to keep the citizens entertained while she schemed right under our noses.<$86>I, for one, was fooled.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen the exhibition of oddities on the west side of town?<$86>It's entertaining and amusing.<S $3D $80> I'd call it the feel-good exhibition of the year!<$86><End>
<$96>Hi pooch.<S $3D $80> You're a good animal--<S $3D $80> well behaved and well groomed!<$86><End>
<$96>Ebon Keep isn't as clean as Ivor Tower was.<S $B5 $80>  It's not as festive, either.<$86>But,<S $3D $80> it's home and I like it.<$86><End>
<$96>How do you like our town?<S $79 $80> Clean and festive, huh?<S $B5 $80> That's the way our queen likes it!<$86><End>
<$96>You're quite a nice pup,<S $3D $80> even though you do look a little silly.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm glad that everything is back to normal here.<$86>That evil twin robot puppet queen was getting on my nerves.<$86><End>
<$96>The queen is trying hard to make everyone happy.<S $79 $80> But,<S $3D $80> it seems like something is missing.<$86><End>
<$96>Well!<S $3D $80> What a nice puppy!<S $3D $80> And so pink and puffy!<$86><End>
<$96>My husband, Lance, travels all around the kingdom and collects valuable treasures.<$86>He's very protective of his finds and he doesn't like for anyone to touch them.<$86>He keeps them in treasure chests upstairs.<$86><End>
<$96>Oh!<S $3D $80> Hello, pup!<S $3D $80> What's your name?<S $3D $80> {Duke?}<$86><End>
<$96>You're the one with strange garb!<S $B5 $80> I hear that you saved our queen and kingdom.<$86>Good job!<$86>Please feel free to take items from our treasure chests.<$86>You'll need them for your journey.<$86><End>
<$96>You're not from Ivor Tower, are you?<S $3D $80> I could tell because of your strange garb.<$86>Please feel free to take items from our treasure chests.<$86>You'll need them for your journey.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, Prince!<S $3D $80> Please, make yourself at home.<S $3D $80> There's plenty of room!<$86><End>
<$96>We're the biggest and richest family in town.<$86><End>
This is our new place.<S $3D $80> Pretty nice, huh?<$86><End>
You're welcome to the items in our treasure chests if you can use them for your journey.<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> what's your name, puppy?<S $79 $80> {Fluffy?}<S $79 $80> {Muffy?}<S $79 $80> {Princess?}<$86><End>
<$96>The giant chessboard used to be a real sight to see!<$86>The pieces used to move all by themselves!<S $79 $80> But,<S $3D $80> some time ago,<S $3D $80> they just stopped!<$86><End>
<$96>I understand that there are trap doors on the chessboard that lead to the chamber below.<$86><End>
<$96>You're very fancy looking,<S $3D $80> what with your pink puffs and all!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello, royal subject!<$86>I see that you've dressed up in your finery for your audience with me!<$86>You're so pink and puffy!<$86><End>
<$96>There was a time that I thought I was the king, but I've come to my senses now.<$86><$96>Of course,<S $3D $80> I still like the robes and finery.<$86><End>
<$96>All hail his majesty,<S $3D $80> me!<S $79 $80> You may grovel in my presence!<$86><End>
<$96>Oh!<S $3D $80> Such a nice animal!<$86><End>
We don't have many animals here.<$86>The queen wants to keep the place clean.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm glad to be back in good old Ebon Keep.<S $F1 $80> Ivor Tower kind of gave me the creeps.<$86><End>
<$96>All of the people here used to live in Ebon Keep.<$86>We moved when the queen built Ivor Tower.<$86>I hear that some people still live in the old town.<S $79 $80> The queen is not very happy about that.<$86><End>
<$96>You certainly seem to be in the festive spirit of our town.<$86><End>
<$96>I love what you've done to your hair!<$86><End>
<$96>That evil twin of the queen turned out to be a real monster!<$86>I'm glad that you stepped in when you did.<$86><End>
<$96>The big pig race will be happening soon!<S $3D $80> It's a town tradition.<$86><End>
<$96>I hear that the queen is going to clean out Ebon Keep.<$86>But, first, her troops have to find a way to cross over to the other side.<$86><End>
<$96>You're quite a regal looking beast.<$86>You don't think that you're king of the poodles, do you?<$86><End>
<$96>My husband snapped out of his king complex when we moved back to Ebon Keep.<$86>I'm glad that he's back to being a plumber with robes and a crown.<$86><End>
<$96>My husband has a king complex.<S $3D $80> But he's not really the king.<S $3D $80> He's a plumber.<$86>The true king of our land hasn't made a public appearance in quite some time.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi puppy!<S $79 $80> You're cute!<S $3D $80> And friendly, too!<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $3D $80> You look familiar!<S $3D $80> Were you at the pig race?<$86><End>
<$96>I like being back in Ebon Keep, but I'm going to miss the pig races.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm going to the pig race!<S $3D $80> It's going to be on the west side of town.<S $79 $80> I like pigs!<$86><End>
<$96>That pig race was great!<S $79 $80> And such an exciting finish!<$86><End>
<$96>You're a nice little dog.<S $3D $80> Can we keep you?<$86><End>
<$96>When we moved back to Ebon Keep, my brothers got lost in the chessboard hedge maze.<$86>I had to go back in and find them.<$86><End>
<$96>When we moved here from Ebon Keep, we went through the chessboard hedge maze.<$86>I got to the end before both of my brothers.<$86><End>
<$96>Dogs are good pets!<S $3D $80> You probably know a bunch of tricks, huh?<$86><End>
<$96>I hope that the exhibition comes to Ebon Keep some time.<$86><End>
<$96>My father took me to the exhibition on the west side of town.<$86><End>
It was creepy,<S $3D $80> but cool!<$86><End>
<$96>You're kind of prissy,<S $79 $80> but I bet you're a good dog.<S $79 $80> Do you know how to fetch?<$86><End>
<$96>My older brother, Lance, went to the forest at the bottom of the ravine once.<$86>He said that it was dark and creepy!<S $B5 $80> I'm going there when I'm as old as him!<$86><End>
<$96>Hiya, King!<S $3D $80> Woof!<S $3D $80> Woof!<S $3D $80> Am I speaking your language?<$86><End>
<$96>Have you been to the ravine below the chessboard?<S $3D $80> It's full of dragons!<$86>I'm going to go there and explore when I'm older!<$86><End>
<$96>You're probably a pretty nice dog, but you look kind of precious.<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the king has snapped out of his puppet show trance.<$86>Now he's ready to watch over the kingdom again.<$86><End>
<$96>I heard that the real king watches some strange puppet show all day!<$86>That's why we haven't seen him in a while.<$86><End>
<$96>Sorry, pup.<S $79 $80> I only deal with two-legged creatures.<$86><End>
<$96>No.<S $3D $80> That won't work.<$86><End>

<$96>Queen Bluegarden?<S $3D $80> What are you doing here?<$86><End>
<$96>Have we met?<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah!<S $3D $80> In Ivor Tower!<S $3D $80> Don't you remember?<$86><End>
<$96>Oh!<S $3D $80> You met the imposter--<S $3D $80> my evil twin!<$86><End>
<$96>Wow!<S $3D $80> This is like what happens in {The Two Doctor Ids!}<$86>We've found evil twins everywhere!<$86><End>
<$96>First, there was Fire Eyes,<S $3D $80> er,<S $3D $80> Elizabeth and her evil twin,<S $79 $80> then Horace,<S $3D $80> and now…<S $79 $80> <End>
you!<$86><End>
<$96>Elizabeth?<S $3D $80> Horace?<S $3D $80> You've met the others!<$86><End>
<$96>Are you from Podunk, too?<$86><End>
<$96>Yes.<$86><End>
<$96>And you were part of an experiment in the mansion on the hill?<$86><End>
<$96>Yes!<$86><End>
<$96>And something went terribly wrong?<$86><End>
<$96>Yes.<S $3D $80> And I've been stuck here ever since.<$86>It hasn't been that bad,<S $3D $80> until a few months ago,<S $3D $80> anyway.<$86><End>
<$96>That's when my twin appeared,<S $79 $80> locked me in the dungeon and took my place.<$86><End>
<$96>Then,<S $3D $80> she presented the king with a hypnotic puppet show which sent him into a trance.<$86><End>
<$96>With the king in his couch potato state,<S $79 $80> the imposter could scheme right under his nose.<$86><End>
<$96>By the time I got out of the dungeon,<S $79 $80> she had moved the kingdom across the ravine.<$86><End>
<$96>Now,<S $3D $80> only a few of us remain in Ebon Keep.<$86><End>
<$96>She sent us here to open the drawbridge so that her troops could clear out the castle.<$86><End>
<$96>That's not good at all!<$86><End>
<$96>It's only a matter of time before she storms in here,<S $B5 $80> with or without your help.<$86><End>
<$96>Listen kid,<S $3D $80> I think that Tinker can help you get back to Podunk.<$86><End>
<$96>But first,<S $3D $80> you're going to have to get rid of that imposter.<$86><End>
<$96>We'll batten down the hatches here…<$86><End>
<$96>And we'll go back to the castle and set things straight before she can cross over.<$86><End>
<$96>That sounds like a good idea.<$86><End>
<$96>Here are <Item> Call Beads.<$86>Throw one to the ground when you need my help.<$86><End>

<$96>Before you leave,<S $3D $80> make sure that you talk to Tinker in the chamber to the East.<$86>He'll be able to help you in your journey.<$86><End>

<$96>Please.<S $79 $80> Call me {Camellia.}<$86><End>

<$96>Oh, you brave little boy!!<$86>Thanks to you, the kingdom is once again filled with happiness and hope.<$86><End>
Before you leave,<S $3D $80> be sure that you talk to Tinker.<$86>He may be able to help you in your journey.<$85><End>
<$96>Hello, Fluffy!<S $3D $80> What a wonderful little dog!<$86><End>
<$96>We're counting on you to go back to the new castle to confront the imposter.<$86>While you're gone,<S $3D $80> we'll batten down the hatches here.<$86><End>
<$96>Before you leave,<S $3D $80> make sure that you talk to Tinker.<$86>His chamber is directly east of here.<$86>He should be able to help you in your journey.<$86><End>
<$96>Wow! <S $3D $80>What cool windows! <S $51 $80>The pictures seem almost… <S $65 $80>alive.<$86>It must be a trick of the light.<$86><End>
<$96>What is it <Dog>? <S $51 $80>What's wrong?<$86><End>
<$96>Whew! <S $5B $80> Those guys were a pane in the glass.<$86><End>
<$96>Hello again, friend.<$86>I trust that my little security measure in the hall didn't give you much trouble.<$86>I haven't introduced myself.<S $B5 $80> <End>
My name is Tinker Tinderbox.<$86><End>
<$96>I deal with scientific matters--<S $3D $80> mechanical inventions,<S $3D $80> alchemy formulas…<$86><End>
<$96>I trust that the queen has told you about our imposter in Ivor Tower?<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah!<S $3D $80> <End>
<$96>We've been encountering evil twins ever since we left Podunk!<$86><End>
<$96>Oh!<S $3D $80> You're from the same place that our queen hails from!<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah!<S $3D $80> There's an abandoned mansion just outside of town.<$86><End>
<$96><Dog> chased a cat into the old place and I followed him.<$86><End>
<$96>The cat wasn't there anymore,<S $79 $80> but we did find a strange machine in an old laboratory.<$86><End>
<$96>The machine zapped us to another lab that looked a lot like the old one.<$86>Only, this lab was in some sort of space station.<$86><End>
<$96>There were two people there.<S $3D $80> One was this scientist, Dr. Ruffleberg…<$86>…the other one looked like it may have been his butler.<$86><End>
<$96>I'm not really sure what happened after that,<S $3D $80> but we ended up on Evermore…<$86><$96>…and we've been here ever since.<$86><End>
<$96>I think I know of this place in space that you speak of!<$86><End>
<$96>I've seen it through my telescope!<$86><End>
<$96>If you want to go back to Podunk,<S $B5 $80> you'll probably find the way up there!<$86>And I think I know how you can get there, too!<$86><End>
<$96>But first,<S $3D $80> we have the matter at hand of the imposter…<$86><End>
<$96>The queen wants us to go back to Ivor Tower and stop her twin from causing more trouble.<$86><End>
<$96>That sounds like a good idea.<S $79 $80> The imposter is scheming at this very moment!<$86><End>
<$96>Take a look!<$86><End>
<$96>Wow!<S $3D $80> She's mean!<$86><End>
<$96>Yes!<S $3D $80> She has to be dealt with,<S $3D $80> in a hurry!<$86><End>
<$96>Crossing the chessboard would not be a good idea at this point.<S $F1 $80> <End>
Her troops will be expecting it.<$86><End>
<$96>I recommend that you go to the North and visit my brother,<S $3D $80> Gomi.<S $F1 $80> He'll help you!<$86>Go through the dungeon to the sewer and then out.<S $B5 $80> You'll find a blocked passage to the North..<$86>You can clear that passage with my axe.<S $B5 $80> You'll find it in my treasure chest.<$86><End>
<$96><$87>Would you like for me to record your progress?
<$97><Choice>OK.

{The Show of Life}<End>
by Billy Shakesbad begins…<End>
Woe be woman<End>
whose fate it is to serve.<End>
May thy tongue shrivel<End>
that it spews such falsehoods.<End>
Ah, but does not a man pull thy strings?<End>
We are all but puppets<End>
of greater powers.<End>
Puppets? As in the show of life?<End>
Truly, birth doth<End>
draw wide the curtains.<End>
And woman, are thy lines scripted?<End>
In that I can be no one but myself,<End>
I can say only my lines.<End>
So sad, to be so constrained.<End>
It is I who feel for thee.<End>
Thine own role and fate<End>
has ever been written,<End>
while mine own<End>
changes with each breath.<End>
Yea, tho puppet I be,<End>
it is hope, faith and Love<End>
that pulls my strings.<End>
Woman, mine ears do sting<End>
from thy tongue.<End>
I shall away<End>
in search of easier folly!<End>
<$96><$87>Look <Dog>!<S $51 $80> A puppet show.<$85><End>
<$96><$87>This reminds me of the classic, {Memphis Topples Leaves.}<$85><End>
<$96>I'll get you,<S $3D $80> you little pest!<S $51 $80>  And that mangy cur,<S $15 $80> too!<$85><End>
Mephista heals Mungola!<End>

<$96>Take <S $29 $80>this,<S $29 $80> little man,<S $29 $80> for what you have done!<$85><End>
<$96>I meant to do that...<End>
<$96>Look,<S $29 $80> <Dog>,<S $29 $80> a gear…<$86>I'm beginning to think that queen was<S $29 $80> no<S $29 $80> lady…<$85><End>

<$96>The big pig race is happening right here in a few minutes.<$86>You can't enter, because you're not a pig!<$86><End>
<$96>I'm going to get a good place to stand for the big pig race.<$86>It's going to be fast and muddy!<$86><End>
<$96>Hello puppy.<S $3D $80> What's your name?<S $3D $80> King?<S $79 $80> Prince?<S $79 $80> Puffball?<$86><End>
<$96>That show at the north end of the street is closed for remodeling.<$86>I hope that the next installment still has an edge.<$86>I don't want it to get too commercial.<$86><End>
<$96>I saw the show in the wagons at the north end of this street.<S $3D $80> It was kind of creepy, but fun.<$86><End>
<$96>I bet that you could run pretty fast.<$86>Too bad pink, fluffy poodles aren't allowed in the pig race.<$86><End>
<$96>The pig race is about to happen!<S $3D $80> I want to get a good view of the action!<$86><End>
<$96>Hey!<S $3D $80> You sort of look like that pig that won the race!<S $3D $80> Are you related?<$86><End>
<$96>Are you going to stay for the pig race?<S $3D $80> Dogs are allowed to watch,<S $3D $80> but not compete.<$86><End>
<$96>Did you see the pig race?<S $3D $80> It had very unpredictable results!<$86><End>
<$96>Are you going to stay for the pig race?<S $3D $80> I am!<S $3D $80> It's the big event of the festival.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen the queen?<S $3D $80> She's almost as pretty as you!<$86><End>
<$96>Did you see the queen at the pig race?<S $3D $80> She's very regal!<$86><End>

<$96>Hello, puppy!<S $3D $80> You're nice!<S $3D $80> And fluffy, too!<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen the king lately?<$86>He's been out of the public eye ever since we moved to Ivor Tower.<$86><End>
<$96>You're a very unique looking dog.<$86>But you're not as unique as those creatures in the exhibition to the north!<$86><End>
<$96>The exhibition at the north end of the city has creatures that I had no idea existed!<$86><End>
<$96>You remind me of a pet that I had when I was younger.<S $3D $80> Her name was {Princetta!}<$86><End>
<$96>The shopping is good in the south part of town,<S $79 $80> but you get the best deals in the alley.<$86><End>
<$96>You're going to have to clear the street soon, dog.<$86>The pig race is coming to town!<End>
<$96>Did you see that show up north?<S $3D $80> It's downright weird!<$86><End>
<$96>You're not one of those Oglins,<S $3D $80> are you?<S $3D $80> No.<S $3D $80> You're too fluffy.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you ever seen an Oglin?<S $3D $80> They're scary all right.<$86>They're a lot more scary than anything you'll see at that show up the street.<$86><End>
<$96>Animals can't trade at the market.<$86>It's because you don't have opposable thumbs,<S $79 $80> or so I'm told.<$86><End>
<$96>I've found more bargains in the alley booths than in the main town.<$86><End>
<$96>The exihibit at the north end of the street is something else!<$86>Too bad poodles aren't allowed.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you seen the exhibit at the north end of the street?<$86>It's both entertaining and thought provoking!<$86><End>
<$96>You can get a ticket at a booth in town.<$86><End>
<$96>You can probably get your master to buy you some goodies at the market.<$86>There are a lot of good bargains there.<$86><End>
<$96>Have you been to the market here?<S $3D $80> You can get some good bargains if you shop around!<$86><End>
<$96>You're quite a cutie!<S $79 $80> I just love fluffy animals!<$86><End>
<$96>The queen has been acting very strange lately,<S $3D $80> ever since we moved to this town.<$86>She's still very nice.<S $3D $80> But, I don't know if she means it anymore.<$86><End>
<$87><$96>OK. Maybe some other time.<$86><End>
<$96>Hi buddy. I'm sorry, I don't have any dog treats for you today.<$86><End>

<$96>I was wondering why my water supply was drying up.<$86>That creature must have been the cause of it!<$86>It's a good thing that you were down there to fight it off.<$86><End>
<$96>How did you get to the bottom of my well, anyway?<$86><End>
<$96>My dog and I were following this underground path!<$86>It's really dark down there!<S $3D $80> And there's a bunch of little guys with cloaks!<$86><End>

<$96>Wow!<S $3D $80> This is some fancy castle!<$86><End>
<$96>I've heard that Phlegm the Fancy did the decorating.<$86><$96>His use of tapestries is simply to die for.<$86><$96>And you should see his custom bookcases in the study in the east wing.<$86>He even used gold paint on their backsides.<$86>They are gorgeous!<S $51 $80> Phlegm has such taste!<$85> <End>
<$96>EVERYONE!<S $79 $80> Please be seated!<S $3D $80> The queen is about to arrive!<$86><End>
<$96>People of Ivor Tower,<S $3D $80> distinguished guests,<S $3D $80>
I present to you,<S $3D $80> her majesty, the Queen!<$86><End>
<$96>Thank you all so much for attending!<S $B5 $80> We hope everyone has a wonderful time.<$86><End>
<$96>And who do we have here?<$86><End>
<$96>This young man is <Boy>, the owner of the winning pig, your highness.<$86><End>
<$96>It is a great pleasure to meet you,<S $3D $80> Mr. <Boy>.<$86><$96>You may call me Queen Bluegarden.<$86><End>
<$96>Uh,<S $3D $80> hi.<S $79 $80> You haven't seen my dog,<S $3D $80> er,<S $3D $80> pig,<S $3D $80> er,<S $79 $80> pigdog,<S $79 $80> have you?<$86><End>
He followed me into the castle,<S $79 $80> and then he just disappeared!<$86><End>
<$96>So,<S $3D $80> tell me,<S $3D $80> Mr. <Boy>,<S $3D $80> what do you think of my new castle?<$86><End>
<$96>I like it!<S $79 $80> It's really…<$86><End>
<$96>Clean?<S $3D $80> Immaculate?<S $3D $80> Spotless?<S $3D $80> Without flaw?<$86><End>
<$96>Yeah,<S $3D $80> sure.<S $79 $80> I guess.<$86><End>
<$96>It is well past time for the main dish,<S $3D $80> don't you think?<$86>I run a tight ship here and I don't like to wait!<$86><$96>What could be taking so long?<S $79 $80> Where is my meal?<$86><End>
<$96>This is an outrage!<S $8D $80> Who is responsible for this filthy beast?<$86><$96>Names!!
I want names!<$86><End>
<$96>Uh,<S $3D $80> th…<S $3D $80> that would be me.<$86><End>
<$96>Make a mockery of my banquet, will you?<$86>Let's see how you feel after a night in the dungeon.<$86><$96>Guards!<S $79 $80> Take these mockers away!<$86><End>
<$96>Ok, buddy.<S $65 $80> Had your fun? <S $B5 $80>Oh, I've seen your type before.<$86><$96>You start by messing up your room and wind up years later messing up banquets.<$86><$96>And your furry friend…<S $5B $80> He looks like a real trouble maker.<S $5B $80> Come along now!<$86><End>
<$96><$87>Would you like to record your progress?
<$97><Choice>OK.
<Choice>I'd rather call a lawyer.<$96><End>
<S $79 $80> Is your destination Omnitopia?
<Choice>Yes.
<Choice>No.<End>
<$96>This is it,<S $3D $80> <Boy>!<$86><End>
You're going to go where no one has gone before!<$85><End>
<$96>We've actually been there before.<$86><End>
<$96>Oh.<$86><End>
<$96>Well,<S $3D $80> <End>
<$96>you've never been shot out of a turret, with a only a minimal chance of survival!<$86><End>
<$96>That's true.<$86><End>
<$96>O<S $1F $80>K!<S $3D $80> Let's go!<$86><End>
<$87><$A2><$80>y<$80><End>
<$87>0<$80>y<$80><End>
<$96>Hi, <$81>!<$86><End>
<$96>Hi!<S $3D $80> That's some contraption you've got there!<$86><End>
<$96>This invention of mine has allowed me to see the lands beyond our kingdom.<$86><End>
<$96>It's quite exciting!<$86><End>
<$96>We've seen a lot of this world, too.<$86>But, we're really interested in going to that space station.<$86>Then we can find our way home!<$86><End>
<$96>Ah!<S $3D $80> Yes!<S $3D $80> <End>
I think that I have a solution for you!<$86><End>
<$96>Now that I've mastered flight with my Windwalker, <S $79 $80><End>
<$96>I'm ready for bigger challenges.<$86><End>
<$96>I think that I can send you into space!<$86><End>
<$96>But, there are some things that I need first!<$86><End>
<$96>Not long ago,<S $3D $80> a volcano erupted on the plateau to the North.<$86><End>
<$96>I know!<S $3D $80> We were there!<$86><End>
<$96>Then you must have seen the machine at the core of volcano.<$86><End>
<$96>I saw pieces of it on the ground surrounding the volcano when I flew by.<$86><End>
<$96>There are two pieces that I need for my new invention.<$86>They are a valve wheel and a round pressure gauge.<$86><End>
<$96>That sounds reasonable.<$86><End>
<$96>And we'll need an energy source, too!<$86><End>
<$96>When the statue in the city to the East exploded…<$86>…there were two jewels that acted as a catalyst.<$86><End>
<$96>That's right-- the Diamond Eyes of the Dog Statue!<$86><End>
<$96>Well then,<S $3D $80> you know exactly what I'm after!<$86>If you can bring me those items…<$86>I'll be able to complete my new invention and send you into space!<$86><End>
<$96>You can take my Windwalker on your journey.<$86><End>
<$96>Cool!<$85><End>
<$96>It can land wherever there is one of these special fire pits.<$86><End>
<$96>Just look for the light.<$86><End>
<$96>Visit me in my lab when you have all of the items.<$86>I'll use them to complete my invention and send you to that place in space!<$86><End>
<$96>I have orders from above, Eronio.<$86>We are to find a device that produces a special kind of energy.<$86>It is somewhere in the kingdom,<S $79 $80> but there is no specific information as to it's whereabouts.<$86><End>
<$96>My superior has ordered me to do whatever it takes to find it…<$86>…even if we must tear the kingdom apart,<S $B5 $80> <End>
<$96>piece<S $3D $80> by<S $3D $80> piece.<$86><End>
<$96>But,<S $3D $80> your highness,<S $3D $80> won't the citizens be suspicious?<$86><End>
<$96>I'll deal with those cretins when the time comes.<S $F1 $80> <End>

<$96><$93>It looks like his insidious villain days are over!<S $69 $81><$87><End>
<$96><$93>So,<S $3D $80> professor.<S $79 $80> What's going to happen to Evermore now?<S $F1 $80><End>
<$96><$93>Hmmmm...<S $3D $80> That's a good question.<S $F1 $80><$87><End>
<$96><$93>I'm not sure.<S $B5 $80><$87><End>
<$96><$93>It was Carltron's influence that created the evil elements on Evermore…<S $B9 $81><$87><End>
<$96><$93>Now that he's unplugged,<S $79 $80> I would suspect that those elements should be going away.<S $69 $81><$87><End>

<$96><$93>Whoa!<S $3D $80> It looks like the big battle scene in {Monsterquake} down there!<S $E1 $81><$87><End>
<$96><$93>Let's go <Dog>.<S $79 $80> We've got to get our friends!<S $69 $81><End>
<$96><$93>We'll do it!<S $B5 $80><$87><End>
<$96><$93>Uh,<S $3D $80> <End>
what do you suppose our chances are?<S $E1 $81><End>
<$96><$93>Yes!<S $79 $80> I believe that Evermore is on a collision course for destruction.<S $91 $81><End>
<S $79 $80><$87><S $3D $80><$96><$93>With Carltron's influence gone, the balance of the world is completely offset.<S $E1 $81><End>
<$96><$93>The only way to reverse the problem is to remove our own influence on the world.<S $1D $82><$87><End>
<$96><$93>We have to leave now,<S $3D $80> and take our friends with us…<S $E1 $81><$87>Or Evermore will be nevermore for ever more!<End>
<$96><$93>Oh!<S $3D $80> This is not good!<S $F1 $80><$87><End>
<$96><$93>Things are getting much worse!<S $F1 $80><End>

<$96><$93><Boy>!<S $B5 $80> You've got to go down there.<S $E1 $81><$87>You've got to find Elizabeth, Horace and Camellia and bring them here.<S $E1 $81><$87><$96><$93>Then,<S $79 $80> we'll return to Podunk together.<S $69 $81><$87><End>
<$96><$93>It's the only hope for Evermore,<S $79 $80> and for us!<S $69 $81><End>

<$96><$93>Is that you, Buddy?<S $B5 $80><$87><End>
<$96><$93>I can't see very well.<S $3D $80>
It's dark in here!<S $69 $81><$96><$87><$93>Hey!<S $3D $80> I think this is some sort of futuristic escape pod!<S $69 $81><End>
<$96><$93>Oops!<S $3D $80> There goes the Control Pad!<S $F1 $80><End>
<$96>You're Professor Ruffleberg,<S $3D $80> aren't you?<$86><End>
<$96>Why,<S $1F $80> yes.<$86><End>
<$96>And you're <Boy>!<S $79 $80> I've been watching you through the monitors!<$86>You're quite an adventurer!<$86>You have the same spirit that inspired me to create this world.<$86><End>
<$96>Of course,<S $3D $80> that was many years ago…<$86><End>
<$96>Now,<S $3D $80> everything is out of whack,<S $3D $80> <End>
and Carltron is on the loose!<$86><End>
<$96>Carltron?<$86><End>
<$96>He's the big guy in the tuxedo who showed me the door!<$86><End>
<$96>Why,<S $3D $80> yes.<S $79 $80> Carltron is my automated servant--<S $3D $80> <End>
or a least,<S $21 $80> he was.<$86><End>
<$96>I constructed Carltron in order to do the household chores.<$86><$96>You know--<S $5B $80> tidy up,<S $5B $80> greet guests,<S $5B $80> pay the bills,<S $5B $80> let the cat out,<S $5B $80> clean the gutters.<$86>And I made him smart so that he could play chess and give me a run for my money!<$86><End>
<$96>But,<S $3D $80> as the years wore on…<S $3D $80> Carltron got tired of being a servant.<$86><End>
<$96>He decided to turn the tables and take over.<$86>First, he sabotaged the experiment.<$86>That left us all stranded in this world of our imaginations.<$86><End>
<$96>Then he schemed,<S $21 $80> <End>
and schemed,<S $21 $80> <End>
and schemed,<S $3D $80> <$96>until he finally made his move.<$86><End>
<$96>We used this machine of mine to come to Evermore.<$86><End>
<$96>And when Carltron took over, he used it to threaten the lives of my friends!<$86><End>
<$96>Carltron is an insidous mechanoid--<S $B5 $80> quite mean indeed!<$86><$96>He said that he'd destroy the planet if I didn't make robot clones of my friends!<$86><End>
<$96>And with these clones leading the lands of Evermore,<S $F1 $80> Carltron would be in control!<$86><End>
<$96>But,<S $3D $80> thanks to you,<S $3D $80> Carltron has been thwarted at every turn.<$86>Now,<S $3D $80> he has retreated to a chamber in the center of Omnitopia.<$86>Of course, he's probably hatching another evil plan as we speak.<$86><End>
<$96>If we can help you stop this guy once and for all,<S $B5 $80> can you help us get back to Podunk?<$86><End>
<$96>Yes!<S $3D $80> By all means!<$86>In fact,<S $3D $80> if Carltron can be controlled,<S $79 $80> the rest of us will return to Podunk as well.<$86><End>
<$96>Let's do it!<$86><End>
<$96>There's a special item on Evermore that is the key to entering Carltron's chamber.<$86>The item is an Energy Core at the base of the chessboard.<$86>If you can retrieve this device, you'll be able to confront Carltron and stop him.<$86>I'll give you access to the core from my control board.<$86><End>
<$96>You'll find a hatch that leads to an escape pod in the next room.<End>
<$86>You can use the pod to return to Evermore and get the core!<$86><End>
<$96>Before you go,<S $3D $80> let me give you a special alchemy formula.<$86>If you have a Meteorite and Dry Ice,<S $3D $80> the formula will create a Call Bead.<$86><End>
<$96>I'll give you <Item> Call Beads.<S $3D $80> Use them when you need my help.<$86><End>
Received <Item> Call Beads<End>
<$96>If you need my help, toss a Call Bead to the ground and I'll be there!<$86><End>
<$96>You're a fine robot--<S $3D $80> not at all evil, like Carltron.<$86><End>
<$96>The Energize alchemy is sure to help you in your fight with Carltron.<$86><End>
<$96>The formula requires a Crystal and one part Iron.<$86>When you cast it,<S $3D $80> your next blow is going to be a big one!<$86><End>
<$96>Carltron is in hidden away in a chamber in the center of Omnitopia.<$86>The key to entering the chamber is the Energy Core.<$86>Take it to the junkyard sector and activate the transport tube.<$86><End>
